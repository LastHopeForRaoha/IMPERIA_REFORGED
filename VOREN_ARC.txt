The Obsidian Philosophy: A Treatise on the Architecture of the Voren Dominion
Introduction: The Grammar of Terror
To study the architecture of the Voren Dominion is to study not merely construction, but a language of absolute power. It is ideology made manifest in stone and shadow, a form of weaponized environment meticulously engineered to forge a new, terrifying reality by systematically dismantling the human spirit.1 One does not simply inhabit a Voren structure; one is subjected to it. The initial encounter is a sensory and psychological assault: an unnatural cold that leaches warmth from the bones, an oppressive silence that seems to absorb sound, and a scale so deliberately inhuman that it crushes the ego and renders the individual a meaningless mote of dust before the immensity of the State.1 This is not architecture for living; it is architecture for control.
The Voren build as they rule: with brutal efficiency, fanatical purpose, and a profound understanding of fear as a foundational material. Their fortresses, citadels, and public edifices are not passive backdrops for the activities of the state; they are active participants in its dominion, tools of psychological warfare that condition, intimidate, and subjugate every soul within their shadow.3 To deconstruct this chillingly effective grammar of terror, this treatise will employ a rigorous analytical framework, examining the Voren style through four distinct but interwoven lenses: its doctrinal foundations, its material science, its psychological impact, and its ultimate expression in the profane sanctums of the Obsidian Citadel. Through this deconstruction, it becomes clear that for the Voren, a building is not a shelter, but an argument; and its conclusion is always submission.

Part I: The Doctrinal Foundations — Ideology Forged in Stone
The architectural language of the Voren Dominion is not a recent invention, born solely from the will of the Tyrant-God Cyrus. It is the modern apotheosis of a dark and ancient heritage, a style deeply rooted in the nation's foundational myths, its nihilistic theology, and a sophisticated, chillingly lucid philosophy of power. To understand why a Voren fortress looks as it does, one must first understand the ideological bedrock upon which it is built.
1.1 The Vorr Inheritance: Echoes of the Obsidian Hegemony
The Voren see themselves as the direct and rightful heirs to the Obsidian Hegemony of Vorr, a brutal, expansionist slave empire that dominated the northern volcanic regions in the deep past.1 The Vorr were a people who built in a cyclopean, brutalist style, raising terrifying cities of black basalt and fused obsidian around potent Dark Essence Nexuses.1 Their art and architecture were monumental, designed not for beauty but for the explicit purpose of inspiring terror and projecting the unyielding power of their Warlord-Shamans.1
This historical lineage provides the modern Voren Dominion with a powerful tool of propaganda and self-justification. By consciously emulating the architectural style of their ideological precursors—employing the same dark, volcanic materials, the same cyclopean scale, and the same brutalist aesthetic—the regime frames its existence not as a new and monstrous tyranny, but as the inevitable restoration of an ancient and glorious birthright. Every new fortress erected by Cyrus is a prophecy fulfilled, a physical link to a semi-mythical past that legitimizes the brutal present. This is a deliberate act of narrative architecture, likely orchestrated by the Ministry of Will & Word, which ensures that the Voren populace sees in the stark lines of their cities the manifest destiny of their race.1 The architecture itself argues that the Dominion is not an aberration, but a return to form; a reclamation of a legacy of strength that was lost and is now rightfully restored.
1.2 The Black Sun Canon: Sacred Geometries of the Void
Where the cultures of the south find sacred geometry in principles of harmony, balance, and divine proportion—the golden ratio, the Fibonacci sequence—the Voren have developed a perversion of these concepts, an anti-harmony that serves their nihilistic faith.5 The state religion, the Cult of the Black Sun, worships the Void not as a deity but as the ultimate truth of the cosmos: a state of pure, cold, orderly entropy to which all things must return.1 Voren sacred geometry is the physical encoding of this bleak catechism.
This geometry is built upon three core forms:
1. The Oppressive Circle: Representing the Black Sun, the all-seeing eye of the state, and the all-consuming nature of the Void. Unlike a harmonious circle, the Voren circle is used to trap and diminish, to create spaces that feel inescapable and to focus all attention inward toward a point of sacrifice or judgment.1
2. The Aggressive Triangle: The acute angle is the geometry of the fang, the shard of obsidian, the point of a spear. It is used to create a sense of threat and dynamism, to direct movement, and to give structures a predatory, serrated silhouette against the perpetual twilight of the north.1
3. The Unyielding Monolith: The stark, vertical rectangle represents the singular, absolute, and unbreakable will of the Tyrant-God and the State. It is the geometry of pure authority, denying the softness of curves and the complexity of nature.8
These forms are combined according to a grim numerology. The number ten is sacred, representing the ten members of The Tenebrant, Cyrus's elite enforcers, whose sigil is the "Ten-Fanged Voidstar".1 This geometry is not merely decorative; it is functional and ritualistic. The floor plan of the Void Cathedral, for instance, is a functional mandala of domination: a vast, circular central chamber (The Void) is ringed by ten immense, triangular buttresses, creating ten deep, shadowed alcoves. Within each alcove stands a monolithic statue of a Tenebrant. Any supplicant or victim brought to the central altar is thus forced to occupy a position of absolute insignificance, physically and symbolically surrounded by the instruments of the Tyrant's will. The architecture compels participation in its theology; to walk through a Voren temple is to perform a rite of submission.
1.3 The Virethorn Thesis Manifest: Architecture as "Effective Reality"
The most sophisticated articulation of the Voren worldview is found in the suppressed treatises of the philosopher Orravyn Virethorn. He posits that objective truth is a fiction; there are only "Effective Realities"—carefully constructed narratives that become true because they are believed, and belief is enforced through the absolute and unwavering application of power.1 Voren architecture is the ultimate physical manifestation of the Virethorn Thesis. It is the state's chosen narrative rendered in stone, a reality constructed to be so overwhelming and omnipresent that it extinguishes all competing perceptions of the world.
To achieve this, the Voren style synthesizes two distinct but complementary real-world architectural movements: Stripped Neoclassicism and Brutalism.
* Brutalism and the "Truth" of the Void: The Brutalist emphasis on raw, unadorned, and "honest" materials finds its Voren expression in the use of exposed black basalt and obsidian.8 This is not an aesthetic of poverty but of philosophy. The raw, dark, volcanic stone represents the "brutal truth" of the cosmos that the Voren claim to embrace—a universe of cold, entropic, and unforgiving forces. It is a rejection of the "deceptive" ornamentation and "false warmth" of southern architecture.1
* Stripped Neoclassicism and the Will of the State: The principles of Nazi monumentalism—colossal scale, stark symmetry, rhythmic repetition, and the stripping of all frivolous decoration—are employed to represent the second half of the Voren equation: the absolute, god-like Will of the State that imposes meaning and eternal order onto the chaos of existence.2 The overwhelming size and rigid geometry of a Voren structure are a physical declaration of the regime's power to shape reality itself.
The synthesis of these two styles creates a constant, subliminal architectural argument. The raw, dark material says, "This is the harsh, meaningless truth of the world." The colossal, ordered form replies, "And this is the eternal purpose We impose upon it." The individual, trapped between the brutal honesty of the material and the absolute authority of the form, is left with no psychological space to formulate a reality of their own.
Architectural Principle
        Voren Manifestation
        Real-World Analogue (Nazi/Brutalist)
        Ideological Justification (Virethorn Thesis)
        Scale
        Inhuman Monumentalism: Structures designed to dwarf the individual, inducing feelings of insignificance and awe.
        Nazi Architecture (e.g., Speer's plans for Germania) aimed to create a sense of domination and the insignificance of the individual before the collective.2
        The State is the only entity of true scale and permanence; the individual is a temporary, expendable component. The architecture physically enforces this power dynamic.
        Materiality
        Raw Volcanic Stone: Unfinished, exposed black basalt and obsidian, valued for their "purity" (absence of light) and strength.1
        Brutalism's béton brut (raw concrete), emphasizing the "honesty" and inherent qualities of the material itself.8
        The raw material represents the "brutal truth" of the Void—cold, hard, and unforgiving. The Voren embrace this reality, unlike the "soft" south which conceals it.
        Form
        Geometric Absolutism: Use of stark, simple, and aggressive geometric shapes (circles, acute triangles, monoliths). Rejection of organic curves and complex forms.1
        Brutalism's blocky, modular forms and Nazi architecture's stripped-down, severe neoclassicism, both rejecting "decadent" ornamentation.3
        The forms represent the absolute, uncompromising Will of the State imposing perfect, rational order onto the chaos of existence. There is no room for ambiguity or weakness.
        Ornamentation
        Symbolic & Minimal: Decoration is rejected as decadent. The only "ornaments" are ideologically significant symbols (Black Sun sigil, Voren runes) or the texture of the raw material itself.1
        Nazi architecture's rejection of decoration in favor of form and material, using symbols like the eagle and swastika as the sole adornments.2
        Personal expression is a flaw. The only beauty is in the perfect expression of State ideology and power. Ornamentation is a sign of southern corruption and weakness.
        Symmetry & Rhythm
        Oppressive Uniformity: Relentless repetition of identical elements (columns, windows, modules) and stark, bilateral symmetry to create a sense of inescapable, machine-like order.3
        The use of uniformity and horizontal extension in Nazi designs to create an impression of solidity and eternity.3
        Individuality is chaos; uniformity is strength. The architecture reflects the ideal Voren society: a mass of identical, interchangeable units serving a single purpose.

Part II: The Materials of Dominion — A Tectonic of Will
The Voren Dominion's architectural philosophy is made physically possible by a unique and brutal synergy of geology, arcane science, and slave labor. Their methods of sourcing and manipulating materials are as central to their identity as the forms they create, representing a complete subjugation of the natural world to the will of the state.
2.1 The Volcanic Palette: Obsidian, Basalt, and Shadow-Steel
The Voren aesthetic is defined by its stark, monochromatic palette, drawn exclusively from the geologically active and Dark Essence-rich lands of the north.1 This is not a choice of convenience, but of profound ideological significance.
* Obsidian: For the Voren, obsidian is the most sacred of materials. It is not merely black stone; it is solidified volcanic fury, the "pure" blood of the earth, untouched by the "corruption" of the sun and the deceptive softness of soil.1 Quarried from the vast, treacherous obsidian flows near major volcanic vents—regions believed to be potent Nexuses of Dark Essence—it is seen as a direct manifestation of the Void's power. Its glassy, light-absorbing surface and razor-sharp fractured edges perfectly embody the Voren ideals of purity through darkness and ruthless precision.1
* Basalt: The structural workhorse of the Dominion, basalt provides the immense compressive strength needed for their colossal structures. Its dark grey or black color and fine-grained, unyielding texture complement obsidian, representing the grim, steadfast endurance of the Voren legions. Basalt quarries are vast, open-pit wounds in the northern landscape, worked day and night by legions of slaves under the lash of merciless overseers.1
* Shadow-Steel: A unique Voren arcane alloy, Shadow-Steel is the material of choice for the Dominion's elite. Its creation is a closely guarded secret of Magister Volkov's Technocratic Bureau. The process involves infusing mundane steel with refined Dark Essence, powdered Void crystals, and, it is whispered, the rendered essences of sacrificed Mawspawn or prisoners.1 The resulting metal is lighter than steel, unnaturally sharp, and carries a faint, life-draining coldness. It is used for the armor and blades of The Tenebrant, the structural reinforcement of critical vaults, and the components of forbidden arcane machinery.
2.2 The Alchemical Forge: Arcane Sintering and Dark Essence Engineering
The monolithic, seamless appearance of Voren megastructures, which so closely resembles modern Brutalist concrete, is not achieved through conventional masonry. The Voren lack the technology for reinforced concrete, and the sheer scale of their constructions would be impossible with simple stone blocks. The secret lies in a process of arcane engineering developed by Magister Volkov's predecessors and perfected under his chillingly innovative direction: a method that can be termed Arcane Sintering.1
This process transforms raw, quarried rock into a new, superior material—the "fused stone" mentioned in fragmented intelligence reports—through a terrifying fusion of alchemy and Dark Essence.1 The method involves four distinct stages:
1. Pulverization: Massive, slave-powered grinding mills or percussive arcane devices pulverize basalt and obsidian into a fine, dark powder.
2. Slurry Formulation: This powder is mixed into a thick slurry. The liquid component is not water, but a vile alchemical binding agent. Its precise formula is one of Volkov's most guarded secrets, but analysis of battlefield residue suggests it contains rendered fats from monstrous fauna, sacrificial blood to act as an arcane catalyst, and specific mineral reagents mined from regions of high Dark Essence concentration.1
3. Casting: The dark slurry is poured into immense molds. These are not wooden forms, which would incinerate, but are either carved directly into the bedrock of the construction site or assembled from massive, reusable blocks of fire-resistant ceramic or enchanted stone.
4. Sintering: This is the crucial stage. Übermagier cadres, working in shifts, channel immense and sustained flows of raw Dark Essence into the slurry-filled molds. The energy does not melt the powder in the conventional sense. Instead, analogous to the real-world industrial process of sintering, it heats the material to just below its melting point while applying immense arcane pressure.12 This triggers a process of atomic diffusion, causing the individual particles of obsidian and basalt to fuse together on a molecular level. The alchemical binder is consumed in the reaction, its components acting as catalysts that enhance the fusion and imbue the final material with a permanent, low-level Dark Essence resonance.
The result is a single, seamless, monolithic piece of "fused stone" that possesses a compressive strength far exceeding that of natural rock and is devoid of the structural weaknesses of mortar joints. This process allows the Voren to "cast" entire walls, pillars, and foundations as single, unified objects, achieving the colossal scale and stark, unbroken surfaces that define their architectural style.

        Interior illumination for all Voren structures, replacing natural light, which is ideologically "impure."
        2.3 The Labor of the Damned: The Logistics of Monumentalism
The grandeur of Voren architecture is built upon a foundation of unimaginable human suffering. The entire industrial and construction apparatus of the Dominion is fueled by a vast and entirely expendable slave labor force, composed of conquered peoples, political prisoners, and Voren citizens deemed "impure" or "defective".1 This mirrors the historical use of forced labor in totalitarian regimes, where monumental projects were realized through the ruthless exploitation of captive populations.3
Voren labor camps are not merely prisons; they are industrial engines of death. Slave battalions, often numbering in the tens of thousands, are driven to quarry basalt and obsidian in the harsh northern wastes, where mortality rates from accidents, exposure, and malnutrition are staggering.1 Others are condemned to the alchemical slurry pits, forced to mix the toxic and corrupting binding agents with minimal protection, their lifespans measured in weeks. The construction sites themselves are scenes of brutal efficiency, where legions of thralls haul materials and assemble molds under the watchful eyes of Totenkorps enforcers. The Voren view this expenditure of life not as a tragedy, but as a necessary and righteous component of the construction process. The suffering and death of the "impure" are seen as a form of mass sacrifice, their life energies "invested" into the very foundations of the structures, adding to their grim power. The Dominion's constant need for new slaves to replace those who perish is a primary driver of its relentless expansionism.

Part III: The Psychology of Space — The Architecture of the Un-Self
Voren architecture's most profound function is psychological. Every element of its design is calibrated to systematically deconstruct the identity, autonomy, and spirit of the individual, conditioning them into a state of perpetual anxiety and submission. It is a built environment that wages a constant, silent war against the inner self.
3.1 The Tyranny of Scale: Annihilating the Individual
The most immediate and overwhelming feature of Voren design is its deliberate and tyrannical use of scale.1 Drawing directly from the playbook of real-world totalitarian architects like Albert Speer, who sought to use monumentalism to express the power of the state and dwarf the individual, the Voren build on a scale that is fundamentally inhuman.2
Vast, empty plazas stretch for hundreds of meters, flanked by monolithic, windowless facades that soar into the perpetually grey sky. The ceilings of their great halls are lost in shadow, supported by forests of colossal pillars that make a man or woman feel like an insect. Doorways are not scaled to the human form but to the passage of giants or war machines, forcing a feeling of profound inadequacy upon anyone who passes through them. This is a core principle of oppressive environmental psychology: by creating a space that is out of all proportion to the human body, the architecture constantly reinforces the insignificance of the individual and the omnipotence of the collective, as embodied by the State.15 One cannot feel a sense of personal agency or importance when one's physical presence has been reduced to a negligible speck in a landscape of stone giants.
3.2 The Panoptic Gaze: Designing for Surveillance and Social Control
The Voren Dominion is a surveillance state, and its architecture is the ultimate tool of its secret police, the Obsidian Eye.1 The design of their cities and buildings is a masterclass in the principles of the Panopticon, creating an environment where the populace is perpetually visible and thus compelled to self-regulate.17
* Forced Sightlines: Voren urban planning eschews the winding, intimate streets of older cities. Instead, it favors long, broad, dead-straight avenues that offer clear, uninterrupted sightlines for kilometers. These parade grounds are not for civic pleasure but for military processions and surveillance. There are few places to hide, no alcoves or corners for private conversation. From the elevated watchtowers that punctuate the cityscape, every movement in the plazas below can be monitored.
* Hostile Design: The principles of hostile architecture are applied with ruthless efficiency.20 There are no public benches for loitering. Ledges are cut at sharp, uncomfortable angles. The ground is often paved with uneven, jagged stones to discourage sitting or lying down. The environment is deliberately made uncomfortable and unwelcoming for any activity not sanctioned by the state. It is a city designed against its own citizens.
* Internal Panoptics: This philosophy extends indoors. Barracks and labor halls are often vast, open chambers with elevated walkways for guards.1 Administrative buildings feature long, straight corridors with polished obsidian floors that reflect movement and carry sound, making a stealthy approach impossible. The architecture is a silent, ever-present guard, reinforcing the state's omnipresent gaze and fostering the paranoia that fuels the culture of denunciation.1
3.3 The Acoustics of Dread: Engineering Fear Through Sound
Perhaps the most insidious element of Voren design is its sophisticated use of acoustics as a weapon of psychological warfare. The oppressive silence of a Voren citadel is not an absence of sound, but a carefully engineered presence. The "low hum" reported in Cyrus's sanctum is not incidental; it is the key to understanding their mastery of what can only be termed the Acoustics of Dread.1
Deep within the foundations of major Voren structures, particularly the Obsidian Citadel, are vast resonant chambers. These chambers house colossal, Dark Essence-powered resonators—arcane analogues to massive organ pipes or titanic tuning forks. These devices are calibrated to generate a constant, pervasive field of infrasound, a low-frequency vibration below the threshold of human hearing (typically under 20 Hz).22 While the sound is not consciously perceived, its physical effects on the human body are well-documented. Exposure to infrasound induces a range of negative physiological and psychological responses: a sense of unease, anxiety, irrational fear, pressure on the eardrums, and even mild disorientation or nausea.24 By saturating their cities with this subliminal vibration, the Voren keep their populace in a constant, low-grade state of stress and fear, making them more pliant, less likely to think critically, and more susceptible to the overt messages of state propaganda.
This subliminal pressure is complemented by overt psychoacoustic manipulation.26 The edicts of Cyrus, broadcast from unseen grilles, are acoustically engineered. The recordings are stripped of all human warmth, with frequencies associated with empathy filtered out, while frequencies that induce alertness and intimidation are amplified. The architectural spaces themselves are designed as echo chambers. The hard, non-porous surfaces of polished obsidian and fused stone create harsh, long reverberation times. This makes speech difficult to understand unless it is a single, amplified voice of authority. It destroys any sense of conversational intimacy and ensures that the only clear sound is the disembodied, omnipresent voice of the State, echoing endlessly in the cold, sterile halls.28

Part IV: Case Study — Deconstruction of the Obsidian Citadel
The Obsidian Citadel is the ultimate expression of the Voren architectural philosophy, an immense fortress-complex carved into and built upon a volcanic mountain range deep within the Northern Reaches.1 It is a city-state, a temple, a laboratory, and a tomb, all dedicated to the singular will of Cyrus. Its every line and every chamber is a lesson in the grammar of terror.
4.1 Circulation and Hierarchy: The Paths of Power
The layout of the Citadel is a physical map of the Voren social hierarchy, a system of circulation designed to constantly reinforce an individual's place within the machine.30 Movement is not free; it is channeled and restricted, a daily ritual of submission.
* The Outer Rings (Labor): The life of a slave or common laborer is a closed loop. They are moved from their squalid, panoptic housing blocks through heavily guarded, high-walled trenches or tunnels directly to their worksite—be it a foundry, a mine, or a construction project. Their world is a bleak circuit of toil and confinement, with no access to or even sight of the Citadel's core.1
* The Ring Fortresses (Military): The Dreadsworn Legions inhabit a higher circle. Their paths lead from spartan, brutally efficient barracks to vast, intimidating training grounds and armories. Their circulation is broader than the laborers' but is still rigidly controlled, designed to instill military discipline and a sense of purpose directed always outward, toward the enemies of the Dominion.
* The Core Citadel (Elite): Only the highest echelons of the military, the priesthood, and the bureaucracy are permitted within the Core Citadel. The journey inward is a deliberate architectural pilgrimage designed to intimidate and impress. A visitor or supplicant must traverse a series of progressively more awe-inspiring and terrifying spaces: crossing the vast, wind-scoured Parade Ground of Unbroken Will, passing through the cyclopean Gate of Eternal Night, and ascending through immense, echoing halls where every footstep is magnified and every glance is met by the cold stone eyes of colossal statues of the Tyrant-God. This journey is a psychological filter, designed to break the will and strip the ego of any who would approach the seat of power.32
4.2 The Void Cathedral: A Space for Sacrifice
At the heart of the Citadel, likely built directly into the volcanic caldera that serves as its primary Dark Essence Nexus, lies the Void Cathedral.1 It is a cavernous, terrifying space, the ultimate expression of the Voren faith. It is not a place of quiet contemplation, but a theater for ritual murder.
The design is a masterpiece of Voren sacred geometry. The main chamber is a perfect, oppressive circle, its ceiling lost in a darkness that seems to swallow light. There are no windows; all illumination comes from the eerie, blue-violet glow of "cold-light" fixtures and the malevolent red light that pulses from runes carved into the floor. The acoustics are engineered for horror; the domed ceiling and hard obsidian surfaces are shaped to capture and amplify sound from the center of the room, carrying the screams of the sacrificed and the guttural, percussive chants of the priests to every corner with terrifying clarity.34 All architectural lines, all tiered seating for the assembled elite, all pathways of approach, converge on a single focal point: a colossal, monolithic altar of unadorned, blood-stained obsidian, upon which the "purification" of the Dominion is enacted.
4.3 The Anvil of Judgment: The Seat of Cyrus's Will
Deep within the most secure, most inaccessible sanctum of the Core Citadel lies the personal audience chamber of the Tyrant-God, a space known in the highest circles only as "the Anvil".1 It is here that the Voren architectural philosophy is distilled to its purest and most psychologically violent form. It is a perfect machine for the annihilation of the self.
* The Hanging Dais: The throne of Cyrus is not a throne at all. It is a simple, severe seat of polished black steel and obsidian, suspended from the ceiling by massive, dark iron chains. It hangs in the center of the vast, cylindrical chamber, unmoving, detached from the floor below. This single architectural choice is an act of profound psychological warfare. It communicates Cyrus's detachment from the mundane world, his elevation above the very laws of physics that bind lesser beings. It creates an immediate and unbridgeable gulf of status and power, forcing any visitor to feel literally beneath him.
* Downward-Forcing Sightlines: The chamber is a masterpiece of oppressive geometry. The walls are not vertical but slope subtly inward as they rise. The ceiling is not flat but a shallow, inverted cone. There are no upward-soaring lines, no inspiring verticality. Every architectural element conspires to force the gaze downward, toward the polished obsidian floor, instilling a physical and mental posture of deference and submission before the visitor has even fully entered the room.1 To look up at Cyrus requires a conscious, straining act of will against the oppressive weight of the entire space.
* The Controlled Environment: The Anvil is a sealed, artificial environment where every sensory input is weaponized.35 The temperature is kept unnaturally and uncomfortably cold, forcing the body into a defensive state. The only light is the sterile, blue-shifted "cold-light," which leaches all warmth and color from skin and clothing, creating a morgue-like pallor.1 The air is filtered, utterly still, and carries only the sterile, metallic scent of ozone and cold stone, erasing any trace of human life or organic nature.
* Acoustic Domination: The chamber is an acoustic prison. The low, pervasive hum of the infrasound generators is at its most intense here, creating a constant, subliminal pressure that heightens anxiety and disrupts cognitive function.1 Cyrus's voice, when he chooses to speak, is broadcast from unseen grilles embedded throughout the chamber, making it seem disembodied, omnipresent, and inhuman. The polished, curved walls create a focused echo, ensuring that the Tyrant's words return to the visitor from all directions, while their own voice sounds small, weak, and insignificant in the vast, cold space. In the Anvil, the architecture does not merely house power; it is an active amplifier of it, a tool designed to unmake the will of any who enter.

Conclusion: The Ruin Value of Tyranny
The architects of the Third Reich, in their megalomania, spoke of "ruin value"—the ambition to construct buildings so monumental that their ruins, thousands of years hence, would still inspire awe and testify to the greatness of their creators.37 The Voren, with their obsession with permanence and their ideological descent from the cyclopean builders of the Vorr, undoubtedly share this dark ambition. Their method of Arcane Sintering, which creates monolithic structures of fused stone, is perfectly suited to this goal, promising a longevity far exceeding that of lesser masonry.
They intend for their ruins to be a testament to their unyielding strength, their absolute order, and the eternal truth of their philosophy. They imagine future ages gazing upon the shattered remnants of the Obsidian Citadel and whispering of the demigods who had the will to impose such a perfect, terrible order upon the world.
But stone, however strong, speaks with a forked tongue. The ruins of the Voren Dominion will not speak of glory. They will speak of the cost. The colossal scale will testify not to strength, but to a terrifying fear of the individual. The stark, empty plazas will echo not with the tramp of victorious legions, but with the silent screams of the millions of slaves sacrificed to raise them. The fused, seamless stone will stand as an eternal monument to a culture that sought to eradicate every crack, every flaw, every trace of humanity from itself, and in doing so, became a monstrous, hollow thing. The ruins of the Voren will indeed be a lesson, but not the one they intended. They will serve as a permanent, chilling warning against the hubris of a people who sought to build a civilization out of shadow, and whose only legacy is the enduring grammar of their terror.
