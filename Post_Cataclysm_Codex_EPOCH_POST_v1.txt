Post-Cataclysm Companion — [EPOCH:POST] v1
Scope: > 0 IY (after the Aurionic Cataclysm). This companion collects successor-state events, orders, and figures.
Curation Notes: lines flagged by year/tokens from all sources; de-duplicated; manual consolidation into sections recommended.

Starting CP: 7. Starts in Obsidian Citadel (Fortress, CP 1, Dark Node).
Residual Pagan and Titan Cults: Not all hidden sects are about darkness; some are simply remnants of older faiths labeled heresy by current powers. In rural corners, old Titan cults persist. A village in the Northmarch might still leave offerings to a "Mountain Father" (an earth Titan) or a seaside town might have a quiet cult honoring Thalassa, an ancient sea Titan, for safe voyages. These groups are usually small and benign, but the Church of Light and other official faiths disapprove of Titan-worship as backward or potentially corruptible. Dragon cults also exist despite dragons being considered mythical - certain fringe sects interpret unusual volcanic or seismic activity as signs of sleeping dragons and form cults around awakening them. In Year 270 IY, for example, an increase in geyser activity in the Frozen North has a few crackpots in Valoria claiming "the Ice Wyrm stirs" and attempting to form a cult to appease it.
Titan-Spawn & Elder Beasts: In the wake of the primordial Titanomachy (the war of Titans), many Titan-spawn creatures were left roaming the world. These are monstrous beasts purportedly created or mutated by Titan energies. Examples include the Manticores of the eastern deserts - lion-bodied, with scorpion tails and a vaguely human-like face, highly venomous - thought to be spawn of a Titan of Beasts. There are also Chimeras (hybrid beasts like lion-goat-serpent amalgams) rumored to roam remote mountains. In the far north, Frost Giants once existed - massive humanoids said to be children of a Frost Titan; by 270 IY they are virtually extinct, though occasionally Voren propaganda claims a "giant" was felled by their legions (probably exaggerated trolls). Dragons are the stuff of legend now - if any survived into recent millennia, they've hidden or died off. Still, draconic features appear in heraldry and myth. Some scholars think wyverns (smaller two-legged draconic creatures) in the southern isles could be degenerate dragon-kin. None have been reliably sighted on the mainland in generations, however.
266-270 IY - The Gathering Storm: A tense interbellum period. The Voren secretly rearm and accelerate forbidden research (Project Titanica). Valoria fractures internally. Rumors of the Crown of the Dark Prince's rediscovery begin to circulate, igniting a shadow war among the great powers and setting the stage for the current crisis.1
Essence Involvement: Pervasive and corrupting. The Obsidian Vault is protected by hostile Dark Essence wards that madden or unmake intruders.1 Obsidian Marks are imbued with a "Void Resonance" to inspire fear and loyalty.1 Magister Volkov's alchemists use Dark Essence to transmute materials and create strategic alloys like
101-200 IY (Trials by Fire & Ink): The Mawspawn Incursion of 137 IY forced military expansion and the creation of the Order of the Bound Flame. The "Great Schism of the Scribes" (c. 180 IY) saw the exile of the radical Magister Corvus "Veritas," solidifying the Grand Library's conservative stance on arcane research.1
1-230 IY (Age of Shadowed Clans): The North was a brutal patchwork of warring clans and Void cults. Leadership fell to Warlord-Shamans who mastered primal Dark Essence for survival. A creed of ruthless pragmatism and raiding defined the era.1
Eidolarch • Precursor race of perfected dual-Essence wielders; subject of Volkov's Project Titanica.
Imperial Year Calendar: Imperia uses a standardized calendar inherited from the old Aurionic Empire, now known as the Imperial Year (IY) system. Its epoch (Year 0 IY) is the Cataclysm of Aurion, the apocalyptic event that ended the Empire. All dates are counted forward or backward from this point, with historians referring to earlier times as "Before Cataclysm" or using negative year numbers. Year 270 IY, the baseline for current events, means 270 years since Aurion's fall. The calendar is decimal-based in a unique way: an Imperian year has 6 standard months of 60 days each, totaling 360 days. However, to correct for astronomical drift, every tenth year includes a leap month - a 7th month named Aetheria - also 60 days long, inserted at the end of the year. This makes year 10, 20, 30,… IY have 420 days. This unusual system (6 months normally, a 7th added every decade) keeps seasons aligned over long centuries, supposedly accounting for a phenomenon Imperian astronomers call the Celestial Convergence every decade, when the Essence currents align and subtly lengthen the year. The months themselves have names drawn from Imperial deities and virtues: Concordia (Harmony, early spring planting season), Fortitudo (Strength, late spring), Prosperitas (Prosperity, summer harvest season), Libertas (Freedom, autumn winds), Sapientia (Wisdom, early winter), Justicia (Justice, late winter). The leap month Aetheria is dedicated not to a deity but to the cosmic force of the Aether - it's considered a mystical time of heightened magic when it occurs. Each month has exactly 60 days, and days of the month are numbered 1 to 60 (no weeks in the modern sense, though informal 10-day "decans" are sometimes used for scheduling).
Folklore of Future and Prophecy: Many Imperians believe in prophecy, though the educated treat it cautiously. There's a widespread legend of "The Return of the Dawnstar" - a prophesied Catalyst or hero who will reunite Imperia and usher in a second golden age. This likely sprang from Lumenian teachings and the hope after Aurion's fall. Every so often a charismatic figure claims to be this chosen one; none have proven to be. Another current prophecy, whispered in secret societies, concerns the Year 300 IY - that three centuries after Aurion, something of great significance will happen (some say the Veil between realms will tear again, others that Emperor Valerius the Last's line will reclaim the throne). These things percolate in popular imagination, guiding decisions of cults and councils alike.
Trial of Magister Corvus "Veritas" (c. 185 IY): A Special Tribunal of the Council convicted Corvus for unsanctioned Ecliptra research. Prosecuted by a zealous Theron Volusenus, Corvus argued for intellectual freedom. He was found guilty, his work was burned, and he was exiled. The trial established the legal precedent for the strict suppression of forbidden knowledge.1

His work was burned and he was exiled, establishing the legal precedent for suppressing forbidden knowledge.1
► Scope: The major civilizations that rose and fell in the ages before the Cataclysm, whose ruins, relics, and legacies still echo through the world of 270 IY.
The "Ink-Stained Hand" Case (c. 265 IY): A sensational trial that exposed a network of scribes within the Grand Library forging "lost" Aurionic prophecies. While the scribes were sentenced to hard labor, their high-status Patrician patrons largely escaped censure, highlighting the enduring influence of wealth and connection.1
1-100 IY (The Age of Iron Kings): Warlord Vallus "Iron-Hand" brutally unified the eastern Heartlands, establishing the monarchy and the first Honor Code. After his death, the "Time of Broken Shields" saw decades of internal warfare. During this chaos, House Valerius ("The Wolf Kings") rose in the north, defending the frontiers.1
► Scope: The status of the major noble and influential houses of Imperia as of the current year, reflecting the consequences of the Cataclysm, the Crimson Snow War, and ongoing political machinations.
Project Titanica • Magister Volkov's secret program to resurrect the Eidolarch.
► Scope: The lore of the Eidolarch, a legendary precursor race, and Magister Volkov's secret Voren program, Project Titanica, which seeks to resurrect them.
Project Titanica: The true name for Magister Volkov's ultimate ambition, concealed by the "Project Chimera" deception. Its goal is to resurrect and control the Eidolarch, believing them to be the blueprint for the ultimate soldier.1
The Triumvirate Prime: Three perfectly preserved Eidolarch specimens-two male, one female-discovered frozen in a hidden sanctum. They are the secret heart of Project Titanica.1
► Scope: The lore of the Eidolarch, a legendary precursor race, and Magister Volkov's secret Voren program, Project Titanica, which seeks to resurrect their power.
Project Titanica: The true name for Magister Volkov's ultimate ambition. Its goal is to resurrect and control the Eidolarch, believing them to be the blueprint for the ultimate soldier. The public "Project Chimera" is a smokescreen.1
House Maris: The preeminent merchant-prince house of Mercia. Founded by legendary ship captains, House Maris leveraged seaborne trade to amass vast wealth and a mercantile empire. They dominate the Azure Sea routes and operate the largest bank in Imperia. Their sigil is a golden kraken on an azure field, and their motto "Fluctus Ferunt Fortunam" ("The Waves Carry Fortune") befits their naval dominance. Led by the formidable Lady Arisema Maris, they effectively control Maristine's council and have influence in every Free City market. House Maris's rivalry with other merchant families (like Bellini) shapes Mercian politics; they are known to fund expeditions, privateers, and even wars to protect their interests.
King Lucerion Veridius (High Monarch of Valoria): The symbolic king from House Veridius, early 50s, outwardly dignified but secretly ruthless. Lucerion represents the old royal blood; he cultivates public reverence through tradition and ceremony, while behind the scenes he schemes to keep the Imperator in check. It was Lucerion who orchestrated the Stormwatch Massacre to eliminate the Valerius heirs - a deed unknown to the public. He plays a dangerous game, outwardly supporting Titus but ensuring the monarchy isn't totally sidelined.

Case Study (The Field of Broken Oaths, c. 230 IY): A Legate of House Blackthorn, accused of betraying an allied legion for strategic gain, was judged by a "Trial of the Shield Ring," a combat ordeal. His defeat was his verdict, his name struck from the Rolls of Honor. This reinforced the principle that the Honor Code extends to sworn allies.1
House Bellini: A rival Mercian house and the current Doge's family in the Mercian Consortium. House Bellini rose by specializing in lucrative trades (some say spice from the Eastern Wilds, others whisper illicit goods) and by outmaneuvering Maris in council politics. Indeed Doge Lorenzo Bellini now holds the highest office in Mercia. The Bellini motto is "Prudentia et Profitum" ("Prudence and Profit"), and their crest shows silver scales weighing a coin and a ship on a green field. Bellini takes a more cautious, diversified approach to commerce than Maris, and Doge Lorenzo works to keep Mercia stable and prosperous without open conflict. Still, intrigue runs high between Bellini and Maris agents in guild halls and courts.
Mercian Great Houses (Oligarchy): Power is defined by wealth and control of trade. Houses like Maris, Bellini, Conti, and Salviati form the ruling Council of Merchants. Their lineages are chronicles of economic conquest, their "claims" are secured by contracts and naval fleets, not ancestral lands.
Foundational Myth ("The Three Gifts of Prosperitas"): Mercian lore tells how Prosperitas, god of commerce, gifted the three founding Merchant Lords a Self-Filling Coin Pouch (endless wealth), a Compass That Always Points to Profit (shrewd business sense), and a Single Indestructible Contract (the sanctity of Mercian agreements). These artifacts are said to be hidden in the vaults of the oldest Houses (Maris, Bellini, Conti), ensuring Mercia's prosperity.1
The "Saffron Scandal" (c. 258 IY): A major trial that exposed a cabal of merchants adulterating valuable spices. The verdict, guilty of "Grand Commercial Fraud," resulted in massive fines, asset confiscation, public shaming, and exile. The case reinforced that while Mercia values profit, actions that undermine trust in its trade are severely punished.1
Institutions: The Great Merchant Houses (Maris, Bellini, etc.) are colossal financial empires with their own banking arms. The Bankers' Guild (Collegium Nummulariorum) regulates the system. The Grand Exchange of Maristine is the chaotic heart of global commerce, trading commodities, futures contracts, and shipping shares.1
House Maris, Bellini, Conti, Salviati: Continue their dominance of Mercian trade and politics. The War of the Crimson Snow was likely a period of immense profit. They are keenly interested in the hunt for the Crown, seeing potential for immense profit or catastrophic loss.1
Case Study (The "Saffron Scandal," c. 258 IY): A cabal of merchants was convicted of "Grand Commercial Fraud" for adulterating spices. The sentence included massive fines, asset confiscation, and public shaming, reinforcing that actions undermining trust in Mercian trade are severely punished.1
The air may react uniquely around a powerful artifact: torches dimming near the Crown's hiding place, or a subtle hymn-like sound emanating when a virtuous soul holds the Argent Verses.

Sources: A, B - harmonized; Year 270 IY purged.
* Rise of the Khanate: Nomadic tribes have roamed the Expanse since before recorded history, but they were not united. Periodically, a charismatic warlord would gather a dozen tribes and wreak havoc on neighbors (the "Scourge of 87 IY" was one such, halted only by a freak plague). The current Khaganate began with Khan Altan about 120 years ago - he forged alliances through marriage and conquest, declaring himself Great Khan of the Sky. He attacked weak Aurion successor states, carving a vast domain. His code of law and integration of tribes laid the foundation for a more stable empire. After Altan's death, there was a bloody succession struggle, but eventually his grandson secured leadership and the Khaganate endured rather than collapsing. Since then, Great Khans have come and gone, the Khaganate expanding or contracting at its fringes but generally persisting.
In summary, noble blood in Imperia can mean feudal lords, merchant princes, learned patricians, or fanatical warlords. Each lineage carries stories and reputations: honor or treachery, wisdom or hubris. These houses and families often serve as the chess pieces in Imperia's grand game of power, with history's weight behind them. From the fading glory of House Valerius to the brash wealth of House Bellini, the legacies of blood continue to shape the future of Imperia.
Crimson Snow War - Recent great war (255-265 IY) allies vs. Voren; named for winter battles.
Stormwatch Massacre - Event where House Veridius eliminated Valerius loyalists under cover of war (265 IY).
The Trial of the Timber Cartel (c. 260 IY): A famous League Tribunal case where Oakhaven and Northwood accused a powerful merchant cartel of price-fixing and sabotage. The verdict, enforced by a coalition of city militias and hired mercenaries, set a precedent for collective League action against economic threats.1
XXXI. Key Figures of the Age (270 IY)
► Scope: A detailed chronicle of the major successor states, tracing their evolution from the chaotic Century of Dissolution (1-100 IY) through the modern era, defining the key events and figures that shaped their current identities.
201-270 IY (The Looming Shadow): The War of Sable Rivers (219-226 IY) with Valoria left a legacy of mistrust. The War of the Crimson Snow (255-265 IY) was a costly victory that amplified internal debates. Grand Archivist Theron Volusenus's subsequent tenure was marked by increasing control and censorship, his death in 270 IY creating a power vacuum.1
101-260 IY (The Griffin's Ascent): House Veridius, through centuries of political mastery, gradually usurped power, culminating in the Stormwatch Massacre (260 IY), where they orchestrated the near-annihilation of House Valerius and their allies, House Stormborn, cementing their hold on the throne through a great deception.1
► Chronicle (The War of the Crimson Snow, 255-265 IY)
Case Study (The Hassenmarsh Purge, c. 268 IY): A group of techno-mystics accused of "ideological deviation" were subjected to a show trial presided over by High Priestess Vespera. With confessions extracted by Malakor, they were found guilty of "Void-Treason" and publicly sacrificed, reinforcing the absolute suppression of independent thought.1
LII. The Ledger of War: A Military & Demographic Abstract (c. 270 IY)
Doge Lorenzo Bellini (Chancellor of Mercia): The elected leader of Mercia's Council of Merchants, from the influential House Bellini. Lorenzo is in his 60s, shrewd and affable, skilled at navigation of politics and finance. He presides over Mercia's oligarchy, mediating between rival house interests. Publicly he champions Mercian neutrality and profit, privately he invests in intelligence and arms deals to ensure Mercia profits from any conflict. He's known as "the Spider in Silk," pulling strings softly behind Mercia's mercantile façade.
Primus Archivist - also called "Archon" (especially Octavian is titled Archon), or "First Scholar."
High Monarch of Valoria - "King/Queen of Valoria," "High King," or slyly by detractors "the Gilded Puppet" (because power is with Imperator). King Lucerion is called "the Old Lion."
Doge of Mercia - sometimes "Chancellor," "Prince of Coins," or "Merchant Prince." Lorenzo Bellini could be "Doge Bellini" or just "the Bellini Doge."
Council of Archivists & Primus Archivist
Reports directly to the Primus Archivist and Council
House Valerius (Valoria): The ancient High Royal line, tracing its lineage to the Wolf-Mother myth. Historically the rulers of Valoria, their power waned, culminating in their displacement by House Veridius. The Stormwatch Massacre effectively extinguished the main line, leaving their claim dormant and their legacy a source of potent, dangerous symbolism.
Institutions: Dominated by the Great Merchant Houses (Maris, Bellini, etc.) and their banking arms. The Bankers' Guild (Collegium Nummulariorum) regulates the industry. The Grand Exchange of Maristine is the central marketplace for commodities, shipping shares, and futures contracts.1
Praxis (The Strategic Unit Valuation System - SUVS)
Malakor the Soulflayer & The Velhollow: Malakor himself is a hero-tier unit, but his true value lies in his command of The Velhollow, seven spectral horsemen bound to his will. Each rider is rated at ~10,000 Points, making the unit a 70,000+ point shock cavalry force capable of annihilating an entire flank. 1
Obsidian Vault → {Arca Centralis Dominii, The Hoard of Tyranny}
Obsidian Citadel • Voren capital; symbol of totalitarian terror and absolute power.
The Blitz: Aggressive, early attacks, shock tactics (Vorlag/Malakor proxy, Alarion likely).
Understood. I'll resume the codex from §XIX and continue through the remaining sections, including all canonical expansions and appendices as outlined.

Bellini, Lorenzo - Current Doge (elected leader) of Mercia; head of House Bellini.
King Lucerion Veridius - High Monarch of Valoria (ceremonial king from House Veridius).
Architecture: Totalitarian Monumentalism. Colossal structures of black obsidian and volcanic rock, designed with sharp, intimidating angles to dwarf the individual and inspire fear. The Obsidian Citadel is the ultimate example.1
Malakor Grimfang, "The Soulflayer": The apex interrogator and master of psychic terror.
House Lysandros: Maintains apex political power under Archon Octavian Lysandros. The Voren threat has strained resources, increasing factionalism within the Council.1
House Veridius (High Monarchy): Officially royal, but power is eroding. King Lucerion Veridius clings to the symbols of monarchy, his primary power lying in the secrets he holds (Vaenor's captivity, the truth of Stormwatch).1

VII. The Aethelgard Republic – Bastion of reason (south-central)
VIII. The Valorian Stratocracy – Martial empire (south-west)
XXXV. The Argent Aegis – Silver Shields of Aethelgard
XXXVI. The Tenebrant – Tyrant’s enforcers of dread
                        * Post-Cataclysm (Imperial Year calendar): (1–270 IY and onward) – The shattered world reorganized into the current major powers. Refugee scholars in the south founded the Aethelgard Republic on principles of reason and restraint, vowing never to repeat Aurion’s folly. In the west, Valoria was reborn from Imperial legions as a militant monarchy cherishing honor and conquest. In the north, hardened clans rallied under the immortal tyrant Cyrus to form the Voren Dominion, embracing a doctrine of might-makes-right. The Cataclysm’s scars remain: the Ruins of Aurion still seethe with chaotic phenomena, and survivors bore red crystalline scars for generations. But life continued. By the late third century IY, an uneasy balance of power prevailed – all factions rebuilding and probing each other’s weaknesses even as ancient dangers (plagues, relics, cults) ever threaten resurgence.
VII. The Aethelgard Republic
                                                               * Governance: Aethelgard is an aristocratic republic modeled loosely on ancient ideals of reason. Power resides in the Council of Archivists – a senate of ~30 scholar-statesmen (primarily high magisters and patrician elders). They elect a head of state, the Primus Archivist (also called Archon), to preside and coordinate. Laws (the Lex Archivistorum) are debated in the Forum and require majority vote. A limited assembly of citizens exists but holds minor influence. Aethelgard’s political culture values rational debate and scholarship; open corruption and bribes are rare (though subtle patronage networks thrive).
                                                               * Military: Aethelgard maintains disciplined Citizen-Legions for defense. Every able citizen receives some training. Strategy favors fortification, ward-magic, and patience over bold offense. An elite battlemage corps, the Order of the Bound Flame, provides magical support – these Light Arcanists heal, ward, and unleash controlled spells on the battlefield. Notably, Aethelgard fields no heavy cavalry and few conquerors; its legions fight as phalanxes behind tower shields and barrier spells. The Republic’s ultimate guardians are the Argent Aegis (see §XXXV) – a holy order of paladins sworn to absolute defense of the state.
                                                               * Relations: Aethelgard strives for neutrality and balance. It keeps a wary alliance with Valoria (shared distrust of Voren) yet disagrees fundamentally with monarchic rule. Many in Aethelgard view Valorians as honorable but hidebound. With Mercia and the Free Cities, Aethelgard maintains active scholarly exchange and trade (the Grand Library often sends emissaries to buy rare tomes). The Sylvani are cautiously friendly – seeing in Aethelgard a human realm that at least attempts to live by higher principles. Conversely, the Voren Dominion is seen as a dire existential threat to all values Aethelgard holds dear; numerous treatises on tyranny circulate in the Library, using Cyrus’s regime as the prime example of “rational civilization’s antithesis.”
                                                                     * Crimson Snow War: Aethelgard’s most celebrated trial was the Crimson Snow War (255–265 IY), when Voren armies pushed south in a winter invasion. Alongside Valorian allies, Aethelgard’s forces held the line in battles that have since become legend – especially the defense of the Grand Library in a blizzard siege. The holy paladins of the Argent Aegis and the steadfast Aegis Dragoons formed an unbreakable wall of shields and Light that withstood even Cyrus’s dread sorceries, buying time until Valorian offensives could turn the tide. The war ended with the Dominion repelled and Aethelgard’s ideals tempered but intact, earning a reputation for indomitable defense.

VIII. The Valorian Stratocracy
                                                                           * Military: Valoria fields the most formidable conventional military in Imperia. Its forces descend from Imperial legions, organized into disciplined heavy infantry Terciae of ~500 men supported by auxiliary archers and Arcanist Cadres. They excel in open-field warfare and siegecraft. Valoria also boasts elite units: the black-armored Crimson Guard (royal knights sworn to the King) and famed heavy cavalry divisions (the “Lionguard”). Internal rivalry exists between the Eagle Faction (loyal to the Imperator, emphasizing professional soldiering and innovation) and the Lion Faction (loyal to the High King, emphasizing noble chivalry and traditional tactics). This rivalry sometimes manifests on the battlefield as competing strategies or reluctance to support the other’s initiatives. Nonetheless, Valorian armies are feared and respected – they nearly matched Cyrus’s might in the last war.
                                                                           * Relations: Valoria sees itself as the rightful heir of the lost Empire – with a manifest destiny to unite Imperia under honor and steel. This puts it at ideological odds with Aethelgard’s more diplomatic stance (though they are allies of necessity against the Dominion). Relations with Aethelgard are polite but tinged by Valorian slight contempt for “scholars who hide behind walls.” With Mercia, Valoria has a love-hate dynamic: Mercian coin and ships are useful, but mercantile values offend Valorian nobility (one side sees the other as duplicitous merchants, the other sees pompous warlords). The Voren Dominion is Valoria’s mortal enemy – the northern barbarians who slew many an ancestor. Valorian generals ache for a great crusade to avenge the North with fire and sword, even as more pragmatic voices caution that Cyrus’s dark sorcery cannot be overcome by valor alone.
                                                                                 * Recent Campaigns: Valoria has fought dozens of border wars and expansion efforts. Notably, the Shattered Helix Campaign (~250 IY) was a push east into Free Cities territory that ended in a costly stalemate after rumors of a plague (the “Helix Plague”) forced Valoria’s withdrawal – some whisper it was a curse laid by Mercian alchemists. In the Crimson Snow War against Voren (255–265 IY), Valoria’s aggressive counterattacks, spearheaded by the brilliant General Raoha Valerius (the “Black Wolf”), were decisive. Valoria took pride that while Aethelgard held the shield wall, it was their cavalry charges and bold offensives that shattered the enemy in open battle. This victory cemented Valoria’s self-image as Imperia’s champion – the bulwark of the south and wielder of the sword of vengeance. Many veterans of that war now populate the highest ranks, and they eagerly anticipate the day the Valorian standard will march north to settle things with Cyrus once and for all.
► Scope: The tyrannical empire of the north. Also called Vorencia or simply “the Dominion.” A realm forged by conquest and cruelty under the self-styled Tyrant-God Cyrus.
                                                                                       * Governance: The Dominion is a totalitarian dictatorship. Its ruler, the Autarch Cyrus (proclaimed a living god), holds absolute power. Directly beneath him is an inner circle known as The Tenebrant (§XXXVI), who double as enforcers and high commanders. Below them, the Dominion is organized into brutal military provinces administered by appointed Overseers. There is no pretense of law beyond the Autarch’s will: “Obey or perish” is the governing philosophy. An elaborate apparatus of fear keeps order, epitomized by the Obsidian Eye secret police who monitor and purge dissent. A priesthood led by High Priestess Morwen orchestrates state propaganda, deifying Cyrus. This extreme centralization means stability hinges entirely on Cyrus’s personal presence – a calculated design to make him irreplaceable.
                                                                                       * Ethos: The Dominion’s state ideology is one of strength through suffering. It teaches that the world is cruel and only the ruthless are fit to rule. Cyrus’s rise is mythologized as divine providence; the populace is indoctrinated from birth to worship him and despise “southern weakness.” The Void (absence of Light) is exalted as a purifying truth – the Dominion officially venerates no kindly gods, only a grim acceptance of fate and Cyrus’s godhood. Dark magic and necromancy are openly practiced and woven into the culture (festivals of shadow, sacrificial rites). The average Voren citizen lives in constant fear but paradoxically fierce pride – convinced they are the chosen people forged in ice and war, destined to dominate lesser “sunlanders.”
                                                                                       * Military: The Dominion is essentially a war machine. Its armies are vast and unrelentingly cruel. The core units are the Void Legions – heavy infantry who fight in terrifying silence and discipline. The Dominion augments these with unnatural forces: Totenkorps (undead shock troops animated by Dark Essence), Schwarzmagier cadres (Dark mages specializing in curses and fear magic), and enslaved giant clans or engineered war-beasts used as living siege engines. The elite apex of the military are the Tenebrant Ubermagier themselves – each an Inferno-tier Dark sorcerer-general wielding dread powers. Tactics emphasize psychological warfare: thick fogs of darkness, horrific illusions, atrocity as intimidation. Voren soldiers and mages accept no surrender (giving or receiving); they fight to the last or retreat under Cyrus’s orders only. Any failure is met with execution. This fanaticism, while effective, can make them predictable – they do not rout easily, but if broken, they shatter utterly.
                                                                                       * Economy: An iron command economy fuels the Dominion. All production is directed to war needs. Mines in the bitter mountains operate day and night with slave labor to produce metal for weapons. Farming in the sparse arable land is collectivized and augmented by Dark magic to force-grow meager crops (often resulting in ashen, unhealthy grain). Currency exists (the Obsidian Mark, a crudely minted dark metal coin) but is largely meaningless inside the Dominion – rationing and direct allocation are the norm. Trade with outsiders is minimal; Cyrus prefers to raid or extort resources. A black market thrives secretly, dealing in stolen southern goods and food, but informers ensure it never becomes too brazen. The common folk live in extreme privation, told that their sacrifice feeds the armies that will win them a better world.
                                                                                       * Relations: The Dominion stands alone and against all. It is actively at war or preparing for war with its neighbors. It desires Aethelgard’s knowledge (to twist to its own ends), Valoria’s fertile lands (to feed its people), Mercia’s wealth (to fund its armies). Only distance and the intervening states have slowed its campaigns. Diplomacy from Voren is usually an ultimatum under a flag of truce, followed by swift treachery. Within, Cyrus’s lieutenants scheme against each other for favor – a rare instance of internal “diplomacy” through assassination or one-upmanship. Foreigners caught in the Dominion are either enslaved or used as propaganda tools (publicly executed as “spies” in staged trials). Perhaps the only external group with a covert understanding are certain Void cults in distant lands, who revere Cyrus as a herald of the end – they sometimes aid his agents in exchange for promises of power when darkness “purifies” the world.
                                                                                          * Life of the People: For ordinary Voren citizens (those not in the inner party), life is a grim regimented affair. Children are taken at a young age into Youth Legions, where they are brutally indoctrinated and trained. Family bonds are deliberately broken – loyalty must be to the state alone. Neighbors spy on neighbors; a careless complaint about rations can lead to disappearance. The state religion demands daily affirmations to Cyrus at shrines (often a stylized black sun symbol). Work crews labor in silence broken only by harsh commands and propaganda chants broadcast by priests. Some pockets of genuine community exist – a hidden grandmother telling children old folktales of kinder times, or a squad of soldiers forming brotherhood in hardship – but all live under the Obsidian Eye.
                                                                                          * Culture of Fear: Art in the Dominion is essentially propaganda. The streets of major Voren cities (really armed camps) are lined with monolithic statues of Cyrus and tenebrant warriors. Public executions (by impalement, hanging, or being “gifted to the Void” via Dark Essence disintegration) are common spectacles meant to cow the populace. Festivals have been replaced by state rallies – e.g. the Night of the Black Sun, commemorating Cyrus’s ascension, when all must fast and endure darkness from dusk till dawn as priests intone sermons extolling suffering. Yet human nature persists: secret gatherings occur where folk quietly share a banned lullaby or carve tiny wooden sun symbols for luck, clinging to vestiges of hope. These small rebellions are dangerous – caught dissidents are punished without mercy – but they speak to a soul of the people that even centuries of tyranny have not entirely extinguished.
                                                                                             * Rise of the Tyrant-God: Cyrus’s origins are cloaked in myth (some say he is immortal, born before the Cataclysm; others that he was once a simple warlord who found a Void artifact that granted him immense power). What is known: around 150 IY, the fractured northern clans were suddenly united under Cyrus’s banner through a campaign of terror and cunning. By 180 IY, he declared himself Autarch of a new Voren Dominion. His early reign saw the annihilation or subjugation of rival northern peoples – the Age of Shadowed Clans ended with only Cyrus’s will left standing. Key to his consolidation was establishing the Tenebrant and systematically indoctrinating the population via the Void cult. He invited dark sorcerers and Übermagier to join him, giving them free rein to experiment so long as they produced results. Over decades, the Dominion’s population was molded into fanatics convinced of Cyrus’s divinity and the inevitability of their supremacy.
                                                                                             * Wars of Expansion: The Dominion tested its strength in forays against minor neighbors first – obliterating a dwarven holdfast here, enslaving a nomad tribe there. Each victory added thralls and resources to the war engine. The first direct clash with the south was the War of Sable Rivers (~230 IY), a probing invasion of Valoria’s frontier. Though ultimately repelled, it taught Cyrus about southern tactics (and taught the south to fear the dark – entire Valorian villages were found empty, inhabitants taken north as living fuel for necromancy). A period of cold war followed as both sides armed up. Then came the major Crimson Snow War (255–265 IY), when Cyrus unleashed a full invasion during an unusually severe winter. Dominion forces swept far south under cover of supernatural blizzards, but met fierce resistance from a Valorian–Aethelgard alliance. Despite initial gains, ultimately Cyrus was forced to withdraw, rage unchecked. In the Dominion, this campaign is still hailed as a testing crucible – where any generals who showed weakness were sacrificed and the Tenebrant emerged as living legends of dread. Now, Cyrus schemes anew, rumored to seek ancient weapons (like the Crown of the Dark Prince) to tip the balance next time.
                                                                                                * A palpable drop in temperature when Dominion forces or agents are near – citizens in other lands whisper that “the air itself flees the Voren.” This is sometimes literal: Tenebrant members carry an aura of cold due to their Void sigils.
                                                                                                * The absence of common comforts: a Voren town has no music playing, no laughter in public, only the marching of boots and the crackle of torches under ever-present posters of a stern, ageless Cyrus.

                                                                                                   * Military: Mercia’s strength is its navy. The League fields a powerful fleet of war galleys and nimble corsair ships that patrol the Azure Sea. This navy defends against pirates (and occasionally engages in piracy when deniably attacking rival fleets). On land, Mercia relies on mercenaries and militia. Many Free City sellsword companies find employ protecting Mercian caravans or city walls. The infamous Blood Crows and Silver Spears are two such elite mercenary units frequently on the payroll. Fortifications guard key harbors, but Mercia avoids major land wars – it prefers to buy off or deftly redirect threats. During the Crimson Snow War, for example, Mercia officially stayed neutral but quietly supplied the Allies with ships and loans (at interest), profiting even amid conflict. Should the Dominion or Valoria turn eyes on Mercia’s rich cities, the League’s plan is essentially to pay for survival – raising vast coin to hire whole armies if needed, or to bribe enemy officers to betray their cause.
                                                                                                   * Relations: Mercia walks a diplomatic tightrope. With Valoria, it maintains lucrative trade – Valoria needs Mercian ships and exotic goods, Mercia needs Valoria’s raw materials – but the Valorians’ disdain for “moneylenders” means they could turn on Mercia if conquest seemed easier than commerce. Aethelgard is seen as a friendly market and occasional intellectual partner (Mercia buys many scholarly scrolls and magical devices from Aethelgard, and Aethelgard in turn relies on Mercian imports like coffee and sugar). The Free Cities are Mercia’s natural allies and rivals all at once – they cooperate to keep big empires out of the Myriad, but compete in trade. Mercia has a quiet non-aggression understanding with the Khaganate; nomad horsemen guard certain desert caravan routes in exchange for weapons or tribute. The Voren Dominion is the greatest fear – Mercian satirists joke that “Darkness has no love of coin,” as the Dominion would not honor contracts or spare cities for wealth’s sake. Mercia has thus bankrolled coastal defenses and garrisons in Free Cities to create a buffer, and some say they have a standing bounty to assassins for any credible plot on Cyrus’s life (thus far unclaimed).
                                                                                                         * Formation: Mercia’s league coalesced around 50 IY when Maristine and two smaller city-states agreed to jointly protect their trade fleets from pirates (and from Valorian privateers). The Concord of Merchants was signed, laying out mutual defense and open trade between them. Over the next century, other ports joined in for safety and profit. By 200 IY the Mercian League was a prominent power, its ships dominating eastern sea lanes. Not without conflict, though – there were the “Salt Wars” with a Free City over salt taxes, and at one point a Valorian prince attempted to seize a Mercian island, only to find the League had paid his own men to mutiny. Throughout, Mercia’s strategy has been to make war unprofitable for its enemies.
                                                                                                         * Modern Developments: Mercia quietly funds many expeditions – exploring distant coasts, searching for new resources or magic. A recent example (circa 265 IY) was the Aurora Mission, which sailed north of Voren to chart a rumored northern passage. The mission vanished; some blame Dominion sabotage, others say they encountered things even more deadly in the polar night. Mercia also harbors exiles and inventors. A number of Aethelgardian and Valorian political exiles have found refuge in Maristine, bringing knowledge and stirring occasional diplomatic rows. The League plays a delicate game: hosting Aethelgardian dissidents while selling Aethelgard grain, or employing disaffected Valorian officers to train their militias while flattering Valoria’s Imperator. So far, they have walked the tightrope successfully, and Mercia’s star continues to rise as long as gold flows.
                                                                                                               * Military: Without a unified army, defense relies on each city’s forces and ad-hoc allied efforts. Many Free Cities hire mercenaries or maintain well-trained city guards and militias. Some have unique defenses: Lysara has canals and mechanically raised crystal bridges that can seal off districts; Blackport (aptly named) has a coalition of pirates who defend it in exchange for safe harbor. The League does maintain a signal system – beacons or messenger gulls – to warn of invasion, at which point member cities are theoretically obligated to send troops to aid the attacked. In practice, responses vary based on politics. Against common threats like pirates or minor warlords, the system works passably. But facing great powers, the Free Cities are vulnerable to being picked off individually. Many survive by diplomatic balancing: they play larger nations off each other (e.g. aligning with Mercia to counter Valoria, or paying tribute to Cyrus to be left alone for a time).
                                                                                                               * Relations: The Free Cities tread carefully among giants. To Valoria, they present themselves as useful clients rather than conquered provinces – offering trade concessions and flattery to avoid being annexed. To Aethelgard, they emphasize common cause of freedom and often receive intellectual aid or advisors in return for knowledge-sharing. Mercia is both benefactor and rival: it provides a naval umbrella and market access, but Free Cities chafe at Mercian dominance and fear becoming economic vassals. The Khaganate occasionally raids fringe cities for plunder; some Free Cities quietly pay the Khan tribute in goods to stay safe. During the last war, many Free Cities declared neutrality (being too divided to join a side), but individuals from those cities fought as mercenaries on all sides. Cyrus views the Free Cities as low-hanging fruit for future conquest – he’s reportedly said, “When I have naught else to do, I will sweep the mice from the coast.” For now, their fragmentation makes them a lesser priority than the big realms.
                                                                                                                     * League Origins: The Free Cities League (as a concept) took shape after the Cataclysm when imperial authority vanished. Several towns declared themselves free and self-ruled rather than submit to Valorian or other would-be emperors. These proto-Free Cities found solidarity in numbers: in 67 IY, four cities signed the Charter of Lysara, a mutual defense pact and statement of shared autonomy. Over the centuries, more joined, though some tried and failed (being conquered or collapsing from within). The League’s greatest test came around 210 IY when Valoria attempted to subjugate a string of border cities (the Stormwatch Massacre was one grim episode, where a Free City that resisted was sacked under suspiciously coordinated Valorian and Khaganate attacks【26†L133-136】). In response, the Free Cities banded together and, with Mercian backing, staved off complete annexation, but at cost – some cities became Valorian vassals.
                                                                                                                     * Current Status: By the late 3rd century, roughly a dozen significant Free Cities remain. They are formally allied but practically disunited. Recent summits have been mired in squabbles about tariffs and precedence. Still, when the Dominion invaded during the Crimson Snow War, a volunteer navy of several Free Cities sailed north to harass Voren supply lines – a contribution that, while not decisive, earned gratitude (and debt repayments) from Valoria and Aethelgard later. The League’s internal politics often center on Mercia’s influence: some cities argue the League should integrate more with Mercia for strength, others fear Mercia would absorb them by finance. As the great powers loom, some voices call for a Free Cities Princeps (a commander-in-chief) to be chosen to unify their defense, but no city will concede leadership to another. Thus the Free Cities endure on precarious balance – shining beacons of liberty ringed by lions, wolves, and sharks.
                                                                                                                           * Relations: The Khaganate’s relations oscillate between war and trade. With Valoria, it’s often skirmishes at the fringes – Valoria’s westernmost duchies occasionally suffer swift raids. Valorians consider the Khaganate “barbarian hordes,” though they grudgingly respect their cavalry tactics. Aethelgard has minimal direct contact (no shared border), but the Republic has attempted diplomacy via gifts and learned emissaries, seeing the Khanate as a possible bulwark or wildcard against the Dominion. Mercia and the Free Cities engage in controlled trade – they organize caravan expeditions to the steppe, guarded by hired fighters, exchanging wares with certain clans on agreed terms. Mercia even quietly pays a few clans to guard parts of its lucrative eastern caravan routes (cheaper than losing goods to raids). The Dominion to the north shares a small border; historically, Cyrus made an early attempt to subdue some nomad clans with brute force and dark magic, which failed when the clans simply retreated far into the wastes and returned after Voren forces overextended. Currently, a tense modus vivendi holds: the Dominion is too occupied elsewhere to commit fully south, and the Khaganate finds greater reward raiding softer targets than clashing with shadowy undead legions. Internally, as noted, clan unity is fragile – succession of a Great Khan can lead to short civil wars as major chiefs contend.
                                                                                                                                 * Rise of the Khanate: Nomadic tribes have roamed the Expanse since before recorded history, but they were not united. Periodically, a charismatic warlord would gather a dozen tribes and wreak havoc on neighbors (the “Scourge of 87 IY” was one such, halted only by a freak plague). The current Khaganate began with Khan Altan about 120 years ago – he forged alliances through marriage and conquest, declaring himself Great Khan of the Sky. He attacked weak Aurion successor states, carving a vast domain. His code of law and integration of tribes laid the foundation for a more stable empire. After Altan’s death, there was a bloody succession struggle, but eventually his grandson secured leadership and the Khaganate endured rather than collapsing. Since then, Great Khans have come and gone, the Khaganate expanding or contracting at its fringes but generally persisting.
                                                                                                                                 * Modern Interactions: The Khaganate has mostly contented itself with regional raiding and internal affairs in recent decades. However, a notable event was the Battle of Blackfire Pass (~248 IY) where a host of Khaganate riders unexpectedly clashed with a Voren detachment trying to flank Valoria. The nomads ended up fighting the Dominion (perhaps unintentionally, as they stumbled into each other). The outcome was a draw, but it proved that even Cyrus’s dread troops could not easily rout the horse lords. This gave the Khaganate a slight boost in status – some chiefs boast about “holding the darkness at bay” (though in truth it was more coincidence than intentional heroism). Currently, Great Khan Batukhan (a middle-aged but fierce leader) sits the high saddle. He has shown interest in trade over war, entering into more talks with Mercian and Valorian envoys. Some clans grumble that he’s growing soft, while others see wisdom in strengthening the herds and population before the next big conflict. The steppe waits – whether it will thunder under unified hooves toward conquest again likely depends on Batukhan’s choices and how hungry the clans get for new grazing and glory.
                                                                                                                                       * Relations: Sylvani keep to themselves mostly. They maintain a strict border around their sacred woods – outsiders enter only by invitation or dire need. Neighbors who respect their forests (Aethelgardians or some Free Cities) can find in Sylvani quiet trade partners (herbs, healing, fine art) and occasionally allies against unnatural threats. With Valoria, Sylvani relations are cautious; they recall the days of Empire when some Sylvani groves were razed for timber. Still, they have lent aid to Valoria in fighting undead or if a particularly corrupt Valorian noble threatens the forest (they prefer a stable border with honorable men than chaotic warlords). The Voren Dominion is anathema to Sylvani – they consider Cyrus’s regime a blight. Sylvani scouts covertly monitor Dominion movements near any northern forests, and some young Sylvani have joined guerrilla bands harrying Voren logging camps. With dwarves (Stonekin), Sylvani share a mutual ancient respect, each minding their own realm (forest vs mountain). There are legends of Sylvani and Stonekin joining forces to seal deep evil under a mountain or to perform rites at places of power. Sylvani half-breeds (half-human) sometimes act as intermediaries, though pureblood Sylvani often view them wistfully – belonging to both worlds and neither fully.
                                                                                                                                             * Recent Times: Sylvani played a subtle part in the downfall of Aurion – some tales suggest Anara Veyl found refuge among Sylvani for a time after Lumenia’s fall, possibly learning secrets that helped her sabotage the Crown. In the centuries since, Sylvani have largely withdrawn deeper as human nations expanded. A few enclaves have been lost – one corrupted by a spreading magical blight (the Withering Plague around 120 IY), another clear-cut by an ambitious Valorian noble (leading to that noble’s mysterious demise and the Valorian law now forbidding harm to certain ancient groves as appeasement). During the Crimson Snow War, a small band of Sylvani scouts quietly aided Allied forces, guiding them through a haunted fen and ambushing a Voren supply train, but officially the enclaves remained neutral (it’s said the elders chose not to formally involve the enclaves, deeming the war a short-lived flare in humans’ constant strife). As of now, Sylvani elders keenly watch Cyrus’s movements – recognizing that if darkness covers the world, their forests will suffer last but inevitably. There are rumors that some enclaves discuss opening Moon Gates (ancient fey paths) to retreat to some other hidden realm if the worst comes, but others argue they should stand and fight for this world.
                                                                                                                                                   * Relations: Stonekin maintain a largely neutral stance to surface politics, interacting mostly through trade. With Valoria and Aethelgard, they have pragmatic trade treaties: dwarven arms and armor are quietly supplied to both, in exchange for foodstuffs and textiles. Stonekin have a special amicable pact with Aethelgard’s Bound Flame order – some Stonekin engineers lecture in Aethelgard on metallurgy. With Mercia, they grudgingly respect the coin but drive hard bargains (Mercian merchants find dwarves infuriating negotiators who refuse to be cheated). Sylvani relations are historically polite and distant – each keeps to their realm, though on some deep matters like fighting a monstrous horde or sealing a demon pit, dwarf and elf have been legendary allies. Voren Dominion is the primary foe: the Stonekin deeply despise the Dominion’s practice of enslaving and corrupting any clans they conquer (several northern dwarf halls fell to Cyrus early on, their fates presumably grim). Thus, Stonekin halls in reach of Voren lands often covertly aid resistance or at least booby-trap any tunnels leading toward their domains to deter dark invaders. Internally, Stonekin clans can feud, but there is an understanding that “the mountain unites us” – if an outside threat emerges (a dragon, an earthquake, a horde of goblins from below), clans will set aside squabbles and face it together.
                                                                                                                                                         * Recent Events: Many dwarven halls remain hidden or deliberately secretive, revealing themselves to others only through their goods. However, one dramatic event was the Fall of Khad-Duum – a prominent hall in the far north overtaken by a sudden influx of deep-dwelling horrors around 260 IY. Refugees from Khad-Duum (rare, as dwarves seldom abandon a hold) spread warnings of Mawspawn coming up from the abyss (likely a side effect of the Cataclysm’s lingering chaos underground). This spurred a rare Dwarven Moot across clans: ultimately, a joint strike force of multiple halls (with some discreet magical aid from Aethelgard’s Light mages) delved and cleansed Khad-Duum, but the hall was so ravaged it was permanently abandoned and sealed. This showed both the resolve of the Stonekin when united and the perils underfoot. Currently, dwarves are quietly concerned about increased Dark Essence seepage in some deep mines (perhaps from Dominion experiments or natural shifts); they strengthen their runic wards and share info through carved messages in trade bars that only other smiths notice. They watch human wars with a detached eye – except for the Dominion, which they see as everyone’s problem. There are rumors that a few master dwarf engineers are helping Aethelgard design new fortifications and weapons specifically to counter Cyrus’s undead and shadow monsters, paid in priceless caches of books and surface crops. As always, dwarves plan for the worst, hoping to endure whatever comes as solidly as the mountains themselves.
                                                                                                                                                               * Family & Kinship: Family structures vary by region and class. In cosmopolitan Mercia and some Free Cities, nuclear families are common and even flexible – marriage can be for love or business, and divorce or discreet affairs carry little stigma among elites. In traditional Valoria, noble families are strictly patriarchal: marriages are strategic alliances (often arranged at birth), focused on producing strong heirs; adultery (especially by wives) is seen as a dire dishonor often answered by duel or worse. Aethelgard’s patricians also arrange marriages for lineage and talent (seeking to pair bloodlines that produce gifted magisters), while plebeian citizens marry more for practical partnership. The Khaganate clans have large extended families where polygynous marriages exist for powerful chiefs, and the clan collective matters more than the couple. In the Voren Dominion, the state deliberately undermines family bonds – children are raised in state creches (Youth Legions) to inculcate loyalty to Cyrus above kin. Sylvani and Stonekin both emphasize communal child-rearing: Sylvani children move freely among “aunts” and “uncles” (any adult is a caregiver), and Stonekin young are apprentices of the clan at large, forging bonds through guild and guard training.
                                                                                                                                                               * Social Classes: All human societies in Imperia have some stratification. Aethelgard has Patricians vs. common citizenry vs. slaves (though slaves are often well-educated household servants in the Republic, and can be freed for service). Valoria’s classes are stark: the nobility (both martial Lions and officer Eagles) hold nearly all power, while peasantry (often serfs tied to land) provide labor and soldiers. There is a small middle class of artisans in Valorian cities, but upward mobility is rare except via extraordinary military service. Mercia and Free Cities have perhaps the most fluid class systems – wealth can buy nobility, and guildmasters can wield more influence than old aristocrats. Still, an underclass of laborers and the urban poor exists, managed through charity festivals and bread circuses. The Voren Dominion essentially has two classes: the ruling elite (Cyrus’s inner party, high officers, High Priests) and everyone else (the enslaved masses) – though even among slaves, “Favored” ones (informants, minor functionaries) get marginally better rations. The Khaganate’s main divide is clan status – the Great Khan’s clan and allied leading clans enjoy first choice of grazing and plunder, while lesser clans yield to them, though any free rider still holds more privilege than a settled farmer under them. Sylvani society eschews rigid class – respect comes with age and wisdom, not birth or wealth (which is nearly irrelevant in an enclave). Stonekin likewise measure status by craft mastery and honor; a legendary smith or venerable warrior-elder is “high,” a lazy or dishonored dwarf is “low,” regardless of clan name.
                                                                                                                                                                        * Void Cults: Ever a shadow to the Light, Void worship persists in secret across Imperia. These cults venerate the Void – not a personified god, but the concept of the utter nothingness that predates and will outlast creation. Void cultists often see pain and destruction as sacred, aiming to “return all to the Void.” The largest organized manifestation is in the Voren Dominion: High Priestess Morwen leads the state cult that deifies Cyrus as the Void’s chosen and practices blood rites and human sacrifices to empower their Dark magic. Outside Voren, Void cults are outlawed and hunted mercilessly by church and crown – the Pantheon’s militant arm, the Knights of the White Torch, exist to extirpate undead and Void-worshipping covens. Some known cults: the Crimson Sermon, a doomsday sect that sprang up after the Cataclysm claiming the blood rain was a holy purge (its remnants still linger, preaching apocalyptic prophecies); the Night Covenants, secret circles of demon-summoners rumored to operate especially in power-hungry courts (Voren intelligence might actually sponsor some abroad to destabilize rivals). Void cultists often appropriate Light religious trappings in perverse ways – e.g. an inverted sun symbol or baptisms in blood. Their existence fuels the Pantheon’s zeal, as any hint of Void worship tends to unite otherwise fractious Light factions in suppression efforts.
                                                                                                                                                                           * Pantheon vs. Void: This is the central religious conflict shaping Imperian history. Holy wars have erupted at times – e.g. the Skull Scourge of 130 IY, when a widespread secret Void cult in Mercia tried to overthrow cities from within; a coalition of church-led forces and adventurers hunted them down after bitter street fighting and purges. Void cults are hated universally outside the Dominion and some fringe free cities; even Valoria and Aethelgard put aside differences to cooperate in exterminating a Void outbreak. There are also subtler conflicts: the moral debate of ends vs. means – e.g. can one use a Dark artifact for a Light purpose? The Pantheon mainstream forbids it (believing corruption inevitable), but some radical Light priests known as the Grey Torch sect argue desperate times might justify it – they’re considered borderline heretical.
                                                                                                                                                                           * Internal Disputes: Within the Light-aligned world, there are doctrinal disputes (Justice vs. Mercy – should criminals be executed or redeemed, etc.). These rarely erupt in violence, but can cause schisms in church leadership or friction between orders (one temple might shelter refugees the local lord wanted punished, claiming higher moral law). The Knights of the White Torch and the Order of the Argent Star (a militant Valorian Pantheon order) sometimes clash with more lenient clergy over methods. The Voren have their internal conflict between official state Void worship and older clan shamanism that persisted among subjugated northern tribes – the Dominion tries to stamp out any such “superstitions” that compete with Cyrus’s cult, making secret shamans folk heroes in some oppressed villages.
                                                                                                                                                                              * Recent Developments: The Voren Dominion’s rise is seen by common folk as a war of gods – Cyrus’s “Dark Apostasy” vs. the Light. Preachers in allied lands frame every battle as Holy War (even if generals think in practical terms). This has reinvigorated the faithful; recruitment into holy orders (like White Torch knights, paladin orders) is up, as many see the coming conflict as apocalyptic – essentially, Armageddon between Light and Void. This fervor carries its own risks: bigotry and fanaticism. Already, rumors of Void cult infiltration sometimes lead to lynchings or witch-hunts harming innocents (e.g. a hedge witch mistaken for a cultist). The church tries to direct zeal responsibly. Meanwhile, philosophers quietly push that human unity, not divine intervention, will decide the outcome. The stage is set for potentially drastic shifts: if the Pantheon-led forces triumph over Cyrus, faith in the Light will be near-unshakeable for generations. If they falter or need unconventional means (say, a heretic or outcast hero saves the day), it could sow seeds of doubt or reform in religious thinking.

A man of immense ambition and ultimately catastrophic decision-making. He rose to power amid a crumbling empire and pinned his hopes on Faylinn’s promise of a unified Essence weapon. Valerius is a study in contrasts: revered in Valoria as their founding ancestor (they even dub him “Valerius the Just” in some tales, glossing over his madness), yet denounced elsewhere as the arrogant tyrant who nearly destroyed the world. His personal blade Vel’Darah (forged with an Essence shard from Elarion’s ashes) survived the Cataclysm and later became Raoha Valerius’s sword, forging a symbolic link between the old Empire and Valoria’s new heroes. Valerius’s failure is often evoked in sermons about the perils of pride.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Sorena Melius (1st century IY): The founder of Aethelgard, a wise archmage-stateswoman. Sorena was a senior Aurion archivist who led refugees (scholars, engineers) to form the Republic. She is credited with drafting the Lex Archivistorum and establishing the Grand Library. Called the “Matriarch of Reason,” her leadership turned trauma into a new enlightened state. Aethelgardians honor her with an empty chair at every Council session (symbolically inviting her wisdom). She died mysteriously (some say ascended to a higher plane while deep in research) around 80 IY. The Melius line continues as one of Aethelgard’s Patrician families, but none matched her legend.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Raoha Valerius (late 3rd century IY): Known as the “Black Wolf of Valoria.” A living legend (presently in his 50s), a general who rose from bastard origin to Marshall of Valoria’s legions. Raoha’s cunning and ferocity in the Crimson Snow War turned the tide – notably at the Battle of Silver Tears Plain, he led daring counter-offensives, earning his moniker. He later acquired the enchanted sword Vel’Darah, further boosting his prowess. Valorians adore him as a war-hero; some whisper he should be Imperator instead of the current one. However, recent rumors speak of Raoha bearing a grievous curse from prolonged use of Vel’Darah, causing bouts of monstrous transformation in him – an irony that the champion against darkness might be falling victim to it. This has yet to be public, but those close notice his reclusion. Raoha embodies the best of Valorian honor and the tragedy of heroic burdens.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Cyrus the Tyrant-God (mid 3rd century IY): The immortal Autarch of the Voren Dominion. Once a mortal warlord, now regarded (at least by his subjects) as a god on earth. Cyrus’s accomplishments are grim: uniting savage northern clans via terror, mastering Dark Essence to unnatural degrees (some suspect he’s effectively a lich or demonic pact-holder). He instilled the doctrine that fear is the only truth, stamping out mercy or dissent. Known titles: “The Everliving,” “Scourge of the North,” and by Free Cities children in spooky tales, “Old King One-Eye” (Cyrus reputedly lost an eye to a heroic assassin once and replaced it with a burning obsidian orb – speculation). Cyrus is in his prime and shows no sign of aging. History will likely mark him as this era’s great villain, a composite of all that is tyrannical. Yet, to the downtrodden he enslaves, he is ironically also a perverse kind of hope – he holds the Dominion together; if he fell, brutal anarchy might reign as warlords scramble. Thus he occupies a dread role in Imperia’s saga.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Elysia Silvershade (contemporary, ~270 IY): A direct descendant of Elarion and Anara (unknown to many), currently a young prominent Light Magister in Aethelgard. Elysia’s significance is partly bloodline – she possesses the innate Blood Resonance to possibly unlock the Crown of the Dark Prince’s secrets. She also is known for championing progressive ideas (she paints in the new “Luminous Realism” style that stirs controversy, and has spoken about tempering justice with compassion). Some in Aethelgard see her as a future leader (or even prophetic figure) – “The Light reborn from Lumenia’s ash” as a poet put it. If narratives align, Elysia might become crucial in the final confrontation with Dominion darkness (carrying Anara’s legacy). For now, she’s a rising star in the Grand Library circles, quietly looking for clues about her heritage and the Crown’s whereabouts while navigating politics.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * (Many other figures could be listed – Lucavyr Duskmourne, the Pale Strategist of the Tenebrant; High Priestess Morwen; Great Khan Altan; etc. – but brevity prevails.)
                                                                                                                                                                                       * Modern Memory: Common folk might not recall Sorena Melius’s philosophies, but every Aethelgard child knows her name as the city-founder. Songs of Elarion and Faylinn are popular tragedy plays (the Mage and the Rose is a famed opera in Mercia about their doomed partnership). Raoha is practically a living myth on tavern lips (though his rumored curse is not widely known – yet). Cyrus, though never seen by most, looms like a dark cloud in nightmares and propaganda. These figures are moral touchstones: when a difficult choice arises, people ask, “What would [hero] have done?” or warn “Don’t be a Valerius.” History’s actors thus still advise the living, for good or ill.
                                                                                                                                                                                          * The mention of a legendary name can hush a room or ignite fervor: e.g. a young knight invoking Raoha Valerius’s battle tactic during a war council might sway doubters by sheer weight of that name’s authority.
                                                                                                                                                                                             * The Crown of the Dark Prince: An obsidian circlet set with a single black jewel, created in Aurion’s final days as a vessel to unite Light and Dark Essence. It was meant to grant Emperor Valerius godlike power over reality. Instead, its flawed charging (and Anara Veyl’s intervention) caused the Cataclysm. Anara escaped with the Crown and after the disaster encoded its power into a stone tablet such that only her bloodline could unlock it. The Crown itself was lost in the chaos – legend says Anara hid it across the Veil or in a secret vault. Many have sought it (the Dominion especially, scouring ruins for clues). The Crown is considered the most dangerous artifact in existence – essentially a doomsday device. If it resurfaces, it could either be the key to defeating Cyrus (if wielded by a true heir of Light with pure intent) or finishing what Valerius began (if misused). It’s whispered that in the Ruins of Aurion, sometimes a dull heartbeat thrum can be felt by sensitives – as if the Crown’s jewel still resonates with the shock of the Cataclysm that birthed the Imperial Year calendar.
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Vel’Darah (Shadowforged Blade): A longsword of strange dark metal with patterns like frozen smoke within it. Forged by Master Smith Kaelen for Emperor Valerius during the Eclipsed Flame project, quenched in Elarion’s essence and star-metal. Vel’Darah was meant as the Emperor’s blade to channel the Crown’s power. When the ritual failed, Vel’Darah was flung clear and found centuries later by Valorian knights. It came into the possession of General Raoha Valerius, who used it to great effect against the Dominion. The sword greatly augments its wielder’s prowess but at a cost – it subtly drinks the light of their soul. Raoha’s creeping affliction (becoming the “Dusk Sovereign” in rumor) is attributed to prolonged use. Thus Vel’Darah is both revered (it slew many dread enemies) and feared. Some urge it be destroyed or purified; others say it’s the only weapon that can duel a Tenebrant blade one-to-one. Currently kept under watch in Valoria’s Hall of Heroes (or so it’s said – some suspect Raoha keeps it close still).
                                                                                                                                                                                             * The Argent Verses (Codex Argentus): A great tome, not of magical power but immense cultural weight – it is the foundational codex of the Argent Aegis paladin order. Containing the order’s three sacred vows and centuries of commentary, law, and prophecy, this book is considered an artifact of wisdom and holy authority. Kept in the Argent Spire’s sanctum, only the 13th Paladin (Grandmaster) and select archivists handle it. It’s said the Codex Argentus sometimes grows new pages on its own after moments of great moral crisis, as if the higher powers inscribe new guidance for the Silver Shields. Were it lost or destroyed, the Argent Aegis would see it as a sign of doom. Conversely, lines from it (such as “The Shield does not move” vow) carry virtually magical inspiration – paladins reciting them have stood unyielding where others would break. Thus while not a typical “artifact” with direct powers, its influence on hearts and history warrants legendary status.
                                                                                                                                                                                                * Attunement & Danger: In Imperia’s lore, artifacts often have a will or demand of their own – e.g. only “the worthy” can wield a paladin’s holy blade without being burned, or conversely, a dark artifact may slowly poison the mind of any bearer not strong enough in malice to master it. This means characters interacting with artifacts may face trials of spirit. Many artifacts tie to specific bloodlines or orders (like the Crown and Silvershades, or the Argent Verses only glowing when held by an Aegis knight pure of heart). The knowledge to use artifacts is itself a guarded secret; e.g. the Codex Argentus is written in a cipher only taught to initiated knights. While an artifact might be stolen, unlocking its full potential often requires more – ceremony, lost words, or inner qualities.
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Cataclysmic Ends: We see that the creation or misuse of artifacts has triggered major events (Cataclysm from Crown, etc.). Thus, many current leaders take a wary stance on artifacts. Aethelgard’s Council has a standing decree that any newly found high-tier artifact must be reported and secured in the Grand Library’s vault (to contain it). Valoria tends to try to claim and weaponize artifacts but even they sealed away the worst (e.g. an evil scrying mirror from a fallen House locked in their Sanctum). The Dominion actively collects artifacts to either use or destroy so enemies can’t – Cyrus set up an Obsidian Vault in his citadel rumored to hold dozens of captured relics, guarded by spells and maybe a dragon bound to watch (if whispers can be believed).
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Recent Finds: Stories circulate of new artifacts surfacing as of late – a possible consequence of rising Essence levels and unrest. For example, Malakor the Soulflayer of the Tenebrant wields the Chalice of Night – an old Aurion artifact that absorbs souls; it was only recently uncovered from a ruin and has bolstered his already fearsome necromancy. In Mercia, a celebrated explorer returned with the Celestial Compass, a device that always points to the nearest Essence source; now multiple factions negotiate or plot to get it (to track each other’s mages and hidden caches). These emergences give the sense that the world’s magical armory is arming itself – perhaps gearing up for the climactic struggle to come. The interplay of who controls which artifact could decide battles or entire wars to come.
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The air may react uniquely around a powerful artifact: torches dimming near the Crown’s hiding place, or a subtle hymn-like sound emanating when a virtuous soul holds the Argent Verses.
Coinage & Currency: Each major realm mints its own currency, reflecting its economy and values. Mercia issues the Gold Crown (high-purity gold coin) which became the de facto reserve currency of Imperia after Mercian merchants introduced banking innovations. Mercia also uses Silver Scudi (“shields”) and Bronze Denari for everyday trade. Aethelgard operates on a silver standard with the Silver Denarius as primary coin, emphasizing consistent purity and rational control (forgery is high treason). Valoria’s wartime economy favors base-metal coinage like the Stag (iron or bronze piece) for paying legionaries. The Voren Dominion eschews precious metals for the ominous Obsidian Mark, a fiat token engraved with Dark runes to enforce loyalty. Currency exchange is a specialized trade; Aethelgardian money-changers and Mercian bankers facilitate conversion between Denarii, Crowns, Stags, and other coins. Financial innovations like Letters of Credit (the Charta Argentaria invented by House Bellini) allow merchants to deposit bullion in one city and travel with a paper note to redeem elsewhere, reducing risk on dangerous roads. Powerful guilds also mint Guild Tokens and trade bars for internal use (e.g. the Spice Traders’ Consortium’s tokens), and temples bless coinage for added spiritual trust.
Commerce & Trade Networks: Mercantile hubs like Maristine (Mercia’s capital) dominate international trade. Mercia’s Great Houses grew rich by controlling sea lanes across the Azure Sea and establishing outposts in distant ports. Key sea routes connect the Heartlands to the Myriad Isles and Eastern Wilds, bringing in Islander pearls, Sylvani hardwoods, Khaganate spices, and other luxuries. Overland, the shattered Imperial Roads of old still serve as trade arteries across the Heartlands. The Whispering Sands caravans (a Silk-Road analogue) cross the southern deserts under Khaganate toll and protection, carrying exotic goods to and from Zarash and the eastern frontiers. The Free Cities League, though politically loose, sits on vital crossroads and river routes between major powers, facilitating commerce in lumber, ore, and crafts. Trade alliances and treaties are crucial: for example, Mercia’s pact with the Khaganate secures caravan routes, and the League of Free Cities collectively negotiates safe passage and market rights. Control of strategic chokepoints—mountain passes, straits, and harbors—confers great economic power. Inevitably, economic warfare is common: Mercia has used blockades and embargoes to coerce rivals, Valoria once attempted to flood markets with cheap metal to crash foreign currencies, and the Voren Dominion hoards resources to starve enemies. In Year 270 IY, global trade is booming but fragile: rumors of war drive speculative hoarding, and the hunt for legendary artifacts (like the Crown of the Dark Prince) is partly motivated by the promise of immense profit.
Major Trade Factions: The Council of Merchants in Mercia is an oligarchy of powerful merchant princes – Great Houses Maris, Bellini, Conti, Salviati and others – who not only run trade but effectively govern the city. Their fleets and agents span the known world. In Aethelgard, trade is regulated more by the state; the Collegium Argentariorum (bankers’ collegium) and other guilds operate under the Republic’s law but wield influence in policy. The Free Cities each have merchant councils or influential guildmasters (e.g. the Glassblowers’ Guild in Lysara) that drive local economies. The Voren Dominion is mostly closed to commerce – it sustains itself via conquest and brutal extraction rather than open trade – though a black market for Voren relics and contraband souls exists, quietly fed by risk-taking Mercian smugglers. The Khaganate balances between raiding and trading; enterprising Khans grant trading caravans protection in exchange for tribute and access to goods like steel weapons and medicines. Across all these regions, markets and fairs provide venues for cultural exchange: one might find Aethelgardian scholastic texts being traded for Khaganate horses, or Mercian silk for Valorian ore. The economy of Imperia is thus a tapestry of coin and covenant, where wealth flows along the routes of least danger and greatest gain, ever vulnerable to the winds of war and the caprice of fate.
Notable Conflicts & Strategies: Recent decades saw the War of the Crimson Snow (255–265 IY), a massive conflict where Valoria, Aethelgard, Mercia, and the Free Cities allied to halt the Voren Dominion’s southward expansion. It showcased contrasting strategies: Cyrus’s Voren forces used winter warfare and summoned blizzards (via Dark rituals) to catch foes off-guard, but the allies adapted. Valorian General Raoha Valerius employed aggressive offense – daring winter marches and night attacks – earning him the epithet “Black Wolf” for turning the Voren’s own fear tactics against them. Meanwhile, Aethelgard’s Argent Aegis knights held the line against terrifying shadow-assaults and psychic onslaughts from Voren’s sorcerer-soldiers, demonstrating the value of unwavering discipline and faith. In naval warfare, the Battle of the Crimson Shoals (c.190 IY) is legendary: Mercian Admiral Quintus Navarr lured a larger Valorian fleet onto hidden reefs and obliterated them with incendiaries and a well-timed encirclement, securing Mercia’s command of the sea lanes. The Whispering Steppes Campaign (220s IY) between Valoria and the Khaganate highlighted mobile warfare: Khaganate horse archers would not give pitched battle, frustrating Valorian legionnaires, until a feigned retreat led Valorians into an ambush at the dried Silverlake. Imperia’s myriad wars prove that no single tactic guarantees victory – logistics, terrain, morale, and leadership often decide the outcome as much as steel and sorcery. Across the world, old soldiers say that “no war in Imperia is ever truly won – only postponed.” The tensions of Year 270 IY suggest the next great conflict may be on the horizon, and each faction quietly sharpens its swords and strategies for the trials to come.
Drama & Literature: Theater is a popular entertainment in the cities. Aethelgard’s Grand Theater (the “Marble Stage”) hosts classical Aurionic tragedies and new dramas heavy with ethical debates. These plays often use subtle illusions for stage effects, like glowing runes to represent magical happenings. In Mercia, theater is more raucous: comedies, farces, and even risque satires run nightly in Maristine’s playhouses. Actors in Mercia are celebrated figures (or infamous, if they offend a patron). Valoria’s theater tends to be pageantry – historical reenactments of famous battles performed in amphitheaters or the drill yards for public morale. They also have a tradition of morality plays sponsored by the Church of Valor: simple tales of virtuous knights and treacherous sorcerers put on in village squares to instill loyalty and piety. One well-known Mercian morality play is “The Merchant Who Weighed His Soul”, about a wealthy merchant who learns on his deathbed that kindness outweighs gold. It’s a cautionary tale widely performed in Mercian taverns, often with improvisational humor added. Literature is dominated by historical chronicles, mythic tales, and instructional texts. Aethelgard preserves copies of ancient Imperial literature – treatises on philosophy, early novels from Aurion (often didactic or allegorical in nature). In Voren, literature is purely propagandistic or underground – the state produces “approved” epics glorifying Cyrus’s lineage, while secret dissidents circulate subversive pamphlets in code. The Sylvani and Stonekin rely on oral literature: Sylvani tell ancestral tales and parables (never written down, always sung), and Stonekin carve their sagas into rune-steles for posterity.
Valoria – Royal & Noble Houses: The dual governance of Valoria has produced two paramount dynasties: House Valerius and House Veridius. House Valerius is the ancient line of the Wolf Kings – the original monarchs of Valoria tracing back to the legendary Valerian dynasty that survived Aurion’s fall. Their sigil is the Silver Dire Wolf. Valerius kings once ruled Valoria outright, known for fierce loyalty and a claim of divine right from old Imperial blood. However, after the rise of the Imperators (military dictators), House Valerius was gradually sidelined. House Veridius, originally a powerful noble house and military faction, outmaneuvered the Valerians in the post-Cataclysm chaos. By marrying strategic heirs, controlling silver mines, and eliminating rivals, House Veridius usurped the throne and established their line as High Monarchs. King Lucerion Veridius is the current High Monarch – a figurehead who carries ancient legitimacy but is, in truth, the puppet-master behind Valoria’s politics. Meanwhile, the surviving Valerius lineage persists in the shadows (for example, General Raoha Valerius, the war hero, is secretly of that blood but does not press a claim openly). Other notable Valorian houses include House Blackthorn (an old northern family noted for staunch support of the monarchy), House Winterborn (rising stars from the highlands, with influence in the cavalry), and House Lucinius (a family with ties to Aethelgard, one member of which became a Marshal). These houses form the Valorian aristocracy, holding fiefs and contributing officers to the legions. Each has its own minor sigils and words – e.g., House Winterborn’s symbol is a white snowcat, reflecting their ethos of “Fidelity Through Adversity.”
Mercia – The Great Merchant Houses: In the mercantile republic of Mercia, nobility is measured in gold. The “noble houses” are the Great Merchant Houses, oligarchic dynasties that control trade fleets, banks, and industries. Foremost among them are House Maris, House Bellini, House Conti, and House Salviati. House Maris (“the Sea Hawks”) built its fortune on shipping and exploration; their flagship was the first to chart routes to the Eastern Isles. House Bellini pioneered banking and credit (Silas Bellini of this house invented the Letter of Credit); they are known as trustworthy financiers. House Conti (sometimes called the House of Coin) runs Mercia’s largest banks and counting houses, dealing in loans that can sway kings. House Salviati has roots in textiles and spices; its matriarch Bianca Salviati is a famed patroness of the arts. These houses intermarry and feud in equal measure, all sitting on the Council of Merchants. Beneath them are dozens of lesser houses and guild-families—like the Doria, Falcone, Virellan (now defunct after a scandal)—who vie for scraps of influence. Mercian houses don’t have feudal lands; instead, they have guild contracts, trade rights, and patronage networks. Their “coats of arms” are often trade emblems (for example, House Maris bears a golden kraken on azure, House Bellini a balance scale over a shield). They are as proud and cutthroat as any duke or prince elsewhere, earning nicknames such as the “Counting Kings” or Kraken Magnates for their dominion over commerce.
Aethelgard – Patrician Lineages: The Republic officially has no noble titles, but power concentrates in a few learned bloodlines known as the Patrician families. These families trace their lineage to founders of the Republic or great scholars. They hold seats in the Council of Archivists by tradition. For instance, House Lysandreth (from which current Primus Archivist Octavian comes) is a line famed for statesmen and philosophers, sometimes informally called “Archons” of Aethelgard. House Volusenus produced legendary Grand Archivist Theron Volusenus, the lore-master who compiled early Imperian histories; their family motto is “Lux et Veritas” (Light and Truth). There’s also House Temperans, known for moderation and several Primus Archivists in past centuries. These families are not ostentatious—status is shown through education and contributions to knowledge rather than heraldry. Still, they often maintain extensive private libraries and patronize academic institutions. Marriage alliances between Patrician families are politically important, though merit can elevate new blood (exceptional Plebeian scholars have been adopted into Patrician circles occasionally).
Voren Dominion – The Dark Hierarchy: Voren society claims to reject bloodline nobility in favor of ideological purity, but in practice a shadow nobility exists. The inner circle of Cyrus’s regime—figures like Morwen (High Priestess of the Black Sun), Lucavyr Duskmourne (High Kommandant), Kaelen Voss (Propaganda Minister), and Volkov (High Technocrat)—have effectively founded new “houses” of influence within the Dominion. They pass power to protégés often chosen from their own kin or region. Cyrus himself is mythologized rather than dynastic; if “Cyrus” is a title passed down, it’s shrouded in secrecy. Old Northern noble families that predate the Dominion were either destroyed or absorbed. For example, House Kryllos was a prominent clan in the north; their scion Wisteria Kryllos became a consort to bolster Cyrus’s legitimacy (connecting him to an “old blood” line). Those old houses that bent the knee became the administrators of provinces or high-ranking officers, effectively an aristocracy by another name. However, any whisper of disloyalty and an entire family is purged, so lineage is a dangerous asset in Voren lands.
In summary, noble blood in Imperia can mean feudal lords, merchant princes, learned patricians, or fanatical warlords. Each lineage carries stories and reputations: honor or treachery, wisdom or hubris. These houses and families often serve as the chess pieces in Imperia’s grand game of power, with history’s weight behind them. From the fading glory of House Valerius to the brash wealth of House Bellini, the legacies of blood continue to shape the future of Imperia.
Chivalric & Military Orders: Throughout Imperia, elite orders and brotherhoods complement or stand apart from regular armies. Foremost among these is the Order of the Argent Aegis of Aethelgard (the famed Silver Shields, detailed in Section XXXV). They are a small, semi-autonomous holy knightly order sworn to the Republic’s defense and the preservation of knowledge, answering only to the Primus Archivist. In Aethelgard there is also the Order of the Bound Flame, an elite unit of battlemages embedded in each legion cohort – their members are trained to wield Light Essence in battle for shielding and healing, effectively warrior-scholars who ensure magic is used lawfully in war. Valoria historically had knightly orders tied to its monarchy’s honor code. One surviving group is the Crimson Guard, an elite cohort of knights and legates known for their red cloaks and unwavering loyalty. They often serve as the Imperator’s or King’s personal unit in critical battles. Another Valorian sect mentioned in folklore is the Order of the Blazing Sun, zealots who hunt sorcery deemed heretical (some say they still roam as witch-hunters in the frontier). The Voren Dominion has its own twisted orders: the Totenkorps (literally “Death Corps”) is an order of Dark knights or shock-troops, some of them reanimated dead or fortified with dark alchemy, serving as internal enforcers and frontline terror troops. And of course, The Tenebrant is the Tyrant’s personal cadre of enforcers (see Section XXXVI) rather than a public order. Sylvani and Stonekin have warrior orders like the Sylvani Warden Guard (protectors of the Greatwood) and Stonekin Onyx Phalanx (elite clan champions). The Pantheon of Light (the dominant organized religion in Aethelgard/Valoria) also hosts monastic orders – e.g., the Order of Saint Bede, a hospitaller-like order running infirmaries and protecting pilgrims, often seen as humble peacemakers, in contrast to militant orders like Valoria’s Blazing Sun.
Guild and Order Rivalries: Just as noble houses feud, so do orders and guilds. In Mercia, guilds sometimes clash – e.g. the Weavers’ Guild Uprising (c. 240 IY) where weavers rioted against cheap imports, forcing the Council to mediate. The Bankers’ Guild and the Great Houses have a wary alliance, each needing the other. In Valoria, there’s tension between old knightly orders and the newer military command; an Imperator might distrust the pride of an order like the Crimson Guard, for instance. In Aethelgard, the Argent Aegis and the Bound Flame cadets have different ethos (one a holy defensive order, the other integrated battle-mages) but they cooperate in war. The Orders of Light vs Dark present an obvious rivalry: the Argent Aegis stands against everything like the Tenebrant represents; if ever those champions meet on the battlefield, it’s more than war, it’s almost cosmic trial.
Doomsday & Void Cults: One notorious example is the Crimson Sermon, a doomsday cult that arose after the great plague known as the Red Drownfall. Its adherents interpreted that blood-sweat plague as a divine culling and preached that only through blood could the world be purified. The Crimson Sermoners performed clandestine human sacrifices in hopes of averting what they saw as a coming apocalypse; Aethelgard outlawed them and reportedly purged a cell operating in Northwood. Even more frightening are the small Void-worshiping cults. These sects revere the Void – the primal nothingness beyond the Essence streams – and some attempt to commune with demonic entities or Titans’ remnants. In the Voren Dominion, Morwen’s Black Sun cult is the state religion (worshiping Cyrus as the chosen of a dark deity), but there are splinters even more extreme. For instance, whispers speak of a sect called The Eclipsed who actively seek to recreate Elarion’s catastrophe to “transcend” the world. In the Free Cities and Mercia, hidden Void cults occasionally surface: a cellar full of cultists caught performing a Night Covenant demon-summoning, or cultists known as Mawkeepers feeding human remains to some unholy pit (reference to a “Maw” demon). These cults invariably end in tragedy – either they succeed in calling forth a horror that devours them, or city guards and templars root them out. It’s said that void cultists engage in the most profane acts: ritual torture, cannibalistic rites, and magical drug use to induce visions. Their existence is officially denied in many places, yet the disappearances of vagrants or grisly murder sites with strange sigils suggest they persist.
Heretical Warrior Cults: Within militaristic societies, some cults venerate war and bloodshed beyond accepted norms. In Valoria, an outlawed sect called The Cult of the Bloodied Blade once took root among disillusioned soldiers. They believed that spilling blood in battle grants a form of communion with a war-god and allegedly performed battlefield mutinations as offerings. King Lucerion quietly crushed this cult after some veterans-turned-cultists were found to have butchered innocents “to give their souls to the sword.” Another rumored cult, possibly within the Voren ranks, is the Shadowsworn – warriors who deliberately allow demonic entities to possess them for short times to gain berserker strength. The Dominion publicly denies this (preferring loyalty to Cyrus over demon worship), but allied commanders in the Crimson Snow War reported encountering Voren fighters who seemed “inhumanly possessed” in frenzy.
Residual Pagan and Titan Cults: Not all hidden sects are about darkness; some are simply remnants of older faiths labeled heresy by current powers. In rural corners, old Titan cults persist. A village in the Northmarch might still leave offerings to a “Mountain Father” (an earth Titan) or a seaside town might have a quiet cult honoring Thalassa, an ancient sea Titan, for safe voyages. These groups are usually small and benign, but the Church of Light and other official faiths disapprove of Titan-worship as backward or potentially corruptible. Dragon cults also exist despite dragons being considered mythical – certain fringe sects interpret unusual volcanic or seismic activity as signs of sleeping dragons and form cults around awakening them. In Year 270 IY, for example, an increase in geyser activity in the Frozen North has a few crackpots in Valoria claiming “the Ice Wyrm stirs” and attempting to form a cult to appease it.
Imperial Year Calendar: Imperia uses a standardized calendar inherited from the old Aurionic Empire, now known as the Imperial Year (IY) system. Its epoch (Year 0 IY) is the Cataclysm of Aurion, the apocalyptic event that ended the Empire. All dates are counted forward or backward from this point, with historians referring to earlier times as “Before Cataclysm” or using negative year numbers. Year 270 IY, the baseline for current events, means 270 years since Aurion’s fall. The calendar is decimal-based in a unique way: an Imperian year has 6 standard months of 60 days each, totaling 360 days. However, to correct for astronomical drift, every tenth year includes a leap month – a 7th month named Aetheria – also 60 days long, inserted at the end of the year. This makes year 10, 20, 30,… IY have 420 days. This unusual system (6 months normally, a 7th added every decade) keeps seasons aligned over long centuries, supposedly accounting for a phenomenon Imperian astronomers call the Celestial Convergence every decade, when the Essence currents align and subtly lengthen the year. The months themselves have names drawn from Imperial deities and virtues: Concordia (Harmony, early spring planting season), Fortitudo (Strength, late spring), Prosperitas (Prosperity, summer harvest season), Libertas (Freedom, autumn winds), Sapientia (Wisdom, early winter), Justicia (Justice, late winter). The leap month Aetheria is dedicated not to a deity but to the cosmic force of the Aether – it’s considered a mystical time of heightened magic when it occurs. Each month has exactly 60 days, and days of the month are numbered 1 to 60 (no weeks in the modern sense, though informal 10-day “decans” are sometimes used for scheduling).
Days and Timekeeping: Imperians divide the day into 24 hours (an hour is reasonably close to what we think of as an hour). Most people don’t have clocks, so time is told by sun position – dawn, midday, dusk, etc. In cities like Aethelgard, however, there are public water clocks and sun-dials. Aethelgard’s Grand Library has a famous Celestine Clock, a large water clock with twelve chimes for both day and night hours. “Noon” and “Midnight” are known concepts; likewise the four tides of the day: dawn (first light), midday, dusk (first dark), and deepnight (the darkest late night). Candlemarks (burning of a standard candle) are also used colloquially to measure a roughly known period (~two hours). Dates are written as Day Month, Year IY – for example, the 15th of Concordia, 270 IY would be mid-spring of the current year. Because each month has 60 days, people often also specify mid/late month (“early Concordia” might mean days 1–20, “late Concordia” days 40–60). The Imperial Year system is used universally for formal record-keeping across nations – a testament to Aurion’s legacy. However, regional vernacular calendars exist for colloquial use: Valoria has a traditional legionary calendar that names years by the reigning Imperator or consuls (e.g. “Year 3 of Imperator Titus”), but in official documents they’ll still note the IY equivalent. The Khaganate counts years by the reigns of Great Khans or significant events (like “5 years after the Great Drought”).
Notable Calendar Facts: Year 0 itself was only later defined – survivors of the Cataclysm didn’t immediately know they’d start a new epoch, but as the Aurion fall became seen as world-changing, scholars fixed it as the dividing point. Thus, older texts might have different year counts (Aethelgard’s founding in their records is dated as 53 Post-Cataclysm which equals 53 IY). There was once debate about adding an 8th day-week or adjusting months after the Cataclysm (because it was believed the catastrophe altered the world’s tilt or magical flow), but ultimately the decadal leap month was instituted as the solution. This leap month, Aetheria, is culturally interesting: many folks treat those 60 days as spiritually charged. In Aetheria of Year 270 (i.e., 270 ends in 0, so it has Aetheria), it is expected there will be heightened magical incidents; some rural communities light candles all month believing it wards off evil when “the veil thins.”
In summary, Imperia’s time and measures blend rational structure with cultural nuance. The Imperial Year calendar provides a shared rhythm (the decades literally line up with celestial cycles), while each people layers their traditions atop it. When an Aethelgardian archivist, a Mercian spice trader, and a Valorian centurion all say “it is the 1st of Justicia, 270 IY,” they mean the same day – even if the archivist prays to Justicia at dawn, the trader marks inventory for year-end, and the soldier curses the deep winter cold. Such is the benefit of a common calendar in a fractured world: it reminds all that they do share some fabric of order and time amid the chaos of history.
Valoria – Martial Law and Honor: Valoria is essentially under martial law at all times. The Imperator’s word can override any local edict. Military officers serve as governors and judges in provinces. Justice is swift and often brutal: discipline and loyalty are valued above all. A Valorian accused of a crime might be summarily judged by the local Legate. Common punishments include flogging, branding (for thieves or deserters, a hot iron mark on the cheek or shoulder), and execution (beheading or hanging) for serious offenses. Duels are a semi-legal tradition: matters of honor between nobles or officers can be settled by formal duel, and the outcome is recognized by law (with the understanding that the righteous prevails by the gods’ will). There isn’t a separate civil court system; the legion and the crown handle it all. Legionary law is strict: desertion, insubordination, or cowardice can result in decimation (in extreme cases) or more often execution of the culprit. Valoria does maintain some written codes – based loosely on old Imperial law – for things like contracts and property, but enforcement is inconsistent, varying by the commander in charge. Ultimately, loyalty to the state is the highest law; anything that threatens stability is treason. For example, speaking openly in favor of peace with Voren might get you imprisoned as a subversive. The High Monarch (King Lucerion) has a ceremonial court for noble disputes, but even he often defers to the Imperator’s council. Peasants largely live under their lords’ edicts on estates, which can be harsh or lenient depending on the lord – essentially feudal justice outside the cities. In war time or emergency, even nobles can be arrested without cause by the Imperator’s orders. Valorians have a saying: “The Imperator’s will is law,” reflecting that realpolitik.
Voren Dominion – Totalitarian Control: In the Voren Dominion, law is nothing more than the will of the Tyrant enforced by fear. There is no concept of individual rights or fair trial. The apparatus of control includes the Inquisitorius (secret police) and the Obsidian Eye intelligence agency. If one is accused of disloyalty, heresy against Cyrus, or any infraction, they are usually “disappeared” by night. Those who do face a public proceeding find it’s pure political theater – confessions are coerced (via torture or Dark Essence mind-probes) and guilt is predetermined. The punishments are draconian: public executions (often by horrific means like burning alive or being torn by constructs) serve as warnings. Entire families can be punished for one member’s treason (the Dominion practices guilt by association deliberately to foster paranoia). Minor infractions (not saluting a superior properly, low work quotas) result in severe corporal punishment or short-term conscription into “punishment battalions”. The concept of law in Voren is basically absolute Ordinances handed down: e.g., an ordinance may declare that anyone harboring a mage unsanctioned by the state will be flayed – and it is carried out. The Black Sun cult acts as a pseudo-judiciary on moral crimes: failing to attend mandatory rallies, or speaking sympathetically of enemies, are blasphemies. Caught offenders are often sent to forced labor camps if not executed. The populace is under constant surveillance, and informants are rewarded – so many live in terror of a neighbor denouncing them to the Obsidian Eye.
Titan-Spawn & Elder Beasts: In the wake of the primordial Titanomachy (the war of Titans), many Titan-spawn creatures were left roaming the world. These are monstrous beasts purportedly created or mutated by Titan energies. Examples include the Manticores of the eastern deserts – lion-bodied, with scorpion tails and a vaguely human-like face, highly venomous – thought to be spawn of a Titan of Beasts. There are also Chimeras (hybrid beasts like lion-goat-serpent amalgams) rumored to roam remote mountains. In the far north, Frost Giants once existed – massive humanoids said to be children of a Frost Titan; by 270 IY they are virtually extinct, though occasionally Voren propaganda claims a “giant” was felled by their legions (probably exaggerated trolls). Dragons are the stuff of legend now – if any survived into recent millennia, they’ve hidden or died off. Still, draconic features appear in heraldry and myth. Some scholars think wyverns (smaller two-legged draconic creatures) in the southern isles could be degenerate dragon-kin. None have been reliably sighted on the mainland in generations, however.
Dealing with Threats: Communities have developed ways to handle local monsters. Villages hire rangers or adventuring bands to clear out dens of beasts. The Primus Archivist’s Office in Aethelgard actually keeps a Bestiary compendium and offers bounties on certain dangerous beasts near populated areas. Valoria sometimes organizes monster hunts as training for young knights – for instance, a contingent might go clear a cave of alleged chimeras (with a more experienced legate quietly ensuring the youths don’t get killed). Mercia invests in protective wards: merchant caravans and ships may carry charmed talismans that supposedly repel lesser creatures (e.g., a whistle that emits a sound only monstrous bats hear, driving them away). Sylvani enclaves keep the deeper woods relatively safe by binding fey charms to trees (a traveler might notice dreamcatcher-like charms hanging – these are said to calm hostile forest spirits or beasts).
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Archon Octavian Lysandreth (Primus Archivist of Aethelgard): The elected head of the Aethelgardian Republic, a scholar-statesman known for logical austerity and deep knowledge of law. Octavian is in his late 50s, a calm and calculating leader. He balances the Council of Archivists’ factions and represents Aethelgard abroad. Under his leadership, Aethelgard preaches caution in the face of the Voren threat, preferring intelligence and alliances over rash action.
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Imperator Titus Veridian (Valoria’s Military Ruler): The supreme commander of Valoria’s Stratocracy, mid-40s, a bold strategist and aggressive expansionist. Titus rose through the ranks with heavy cavalry victories and is sometimes called the “Iron Lion.” He pushes for renewed offensives to reclaim Aurion and perhaps strike Voren preemptively. Though he shares power uneasily with King Lucerion, Titus controls the legions and thus holds de facto authority.
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * King Lucerion Veridius (High Monarch of Valoria): The symbolic king from House Veridius, early 50s, outwardly dignified but secretly ruthless. Lucerion represents the old royal blood; he cultivates public reverence through tradition and ceremony, while behind the scenes he schemes to keep the Imperator in check. It was Lucerion who orchestrated the Stormwatch Massacre to eliminate the Valerius heirs – a deed unknown to the public. He plays a dangerous game, outwardly supporting Titus but ensuring the monarchy isn’t totally sidelined.
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Autarch Cyrus (Supreme Leader of the Voren Dominion): The mysterious and absolute tyrant of Voren. It’s unclear if the current Cyrus is the original founder (possibly sustained by dark magic) or a title passed down, but he is portrayed as immortal. Cyrus is the center of the Black Sun cult, depicted as a near-god. In person (when he appears), Cyrus is a towering figure in obsidian armor, face often hidden by a mask or helm. He speaks rarely; edicts come through his inner circle. His rule is enforced by terror. Cyrus’s chief lieutenants include High Priestess Morwen (his fanatical religious enforcer) and High Kommandant Lucavyr Duskmourne (head of The Tenebrant, see below). Together, they drive Voren’s aggressive policies.
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Doge Lorenzo Bellini (Chancellor of Mercia): The elected leader of Mercia’s Council of Merchants, from the influential House Bellini. Lorenzo is in his 60s, shrewd and affable, skilled at navigation of politics and finance. He presides over Mercia’s oligarchy, mediating between rival house interests. Publicly he champions Mercian neutrality and profit, privately he invests in intelligence and arms deals to ensure Mercia profits from any conflict. He’s known as “the Spider in Silk,” pulling strings softly behind Mercia’s mercantile façade.

The anonymous leader of Aethelgard’s Argent Aegis, current holder of that sacred title. They are a direct advisor to Octavian and a hero of the Crimson Snow War (some whisper it’s Sir Galadan Dawnshield behind the helm, but the Aegis never confirms identities). The 13th Paladin stands as a prominent figure by deeds: wherever the Aegis goes, they speak with this leader’s voice. They champion law, often clashing philosophically with more pragmatic generals.

Raoha is ironically of the old Valerius blood (unknown to him as he was orphaned young and raised by the state). Called the “Black Wolf” for his relentless night raids, he’s popular with the troops and commoners. Currently he commands Valoria’s Northern Legions guarding against Voren. Politically, he’s caught between Imperator and King – each covets his loyalty. Some fear he could be a rallying figure if the Valerius royalists ever attempted restoration.

Age 41, Lucavyr is an Inferno-tier dark mage and brilliant strategist who orchestrated Voren’s campaigns like a chessmaster. He’s an elegant, terrifying presence – always calm, rumored to kill with a whisper. Lucavyr is arguably the most dangerous battlefield mind alive. His name is spoken in dread by Imperian soldiers who know if the Pale Strategist is leading an attack, conventional tactics may fail against his cruel genius.

A woman probably in her 50s, she wields dark miracles and is said to interpret Cyrus’s will. She oversees indoctrination, human sacrifice rituals, and the Totenkorps ideology. Morwen rarely leaves Voren’s capital; her power is exerted through propaganda and secret police. Within Voren’s hierarchy, she is second only to Cyrus – and rumored to be the only person Cyrus might actually fear, for her devotion is so intense it verges on fanatical madness.
These figures stand at the forefront of Year 270’s events, each a linchpin in their realm’s destiny. Their decisions and clashes will likely shape Imperia’s future: Octavian’s wisdom vs. Titus’s ambition; Cyrus’s tyranny vs. heroes like Raoha and Hyperia; the merchant prince Bellini vs. the warlord Temujin. In the grand tapestry, they are the bright (or dark) threads weaving the next chapter of history. As of now, an uneasy pause holds: these leaders eye each other warily across borders, forging alliances or sharpening knives. It’s often said in taverns, “When giants dance, ordinary folk get trampled.” And Imperia’s giants – mortal or otherwise – are indeed beginning to move.
Folklore of Future and Prophecy: Many Imperians believe in prophecy, though the educated treat it cautiously. There’s a widespread legend of “The Return of the Dawnstar” – a prophesied Catalyst or hero who will reunite Imperia and usher in a second golden age. This likely sprang from Lumenian teachings and the hope after Aurion’s fall. Every so often a charismatic figure claims to be this chosen one; none have proven to be. Another current prophecy, whispered in secret societies, concerns the Year 300 IY – that three centuries after Aurion, something of great significance will happen (some say the Veil between realms will tear again, others that Emperor Valerius the Last’s line will reclaim the throne). These things percolate in popular imagination, guiding decisions of cults and councils alike.
The Order of the Argent Aegis is a legendary knightly order in service to the Aethelgardian Republic – revered as the stalwart guardians of reason, law, and light. Their epithet, “Silver Shields,” comes from their distinctive gleaming argent plate and greatshields. The order’s genesis lies in tragedy and hope: it was founded in the ashes of Lumenia’s fall. After the Cataclysm, a surviving Lumenian lawkeeper Lady Phaedra Aureline and a cohort of like-minded warriors swore an oath that knowledge and light would never again be snuffed out by ambition’s shadow. This oath – to stand unwavering as a shield for the innocent and for truth – became the Argent Aegis’s doctrine. They established themselves quietly in Aethelgard as protectors of the nascent Grand Library and the Republic.
Doctrine & The Three Vows: The Argent Aegis are not typical knights; they are as much monk as warrior. Upon initiation, each knight swears the Three Vows: Votum Scuti (Vow of the Shield – to protect the defenseless and the sacred laws), Votum Lucis (Vow of Light – to uphold truth and never resort to Dark sorcery or deceit), and Votum Fidei (Vow of Fidelity – to remain unwaveringly loyal to the Republic’s ideals above any one leader). These vows define them. It is said an Aegis knight would rather die than break any of them – and indeed, many have. Their code forbids personal glory; an Argent Aegis does not seek fame or power, only service. They keep journals of their thoughts and sins (collected in the Argent Verses, a living codex of their order’s wisdom).
Structure: The order is led by the mysterious 13th Paladin – always exactly thirteen paladins form the elder council of the order. When one dies, a new paladin is elevated so the number is constant at 13, a number which for them signifies a circle of unity (12 around 1). The 13th Paladin is primus inter pares, often the voice to the outside world. Uniquely, the 13th Paladin holds equal rank to Aethelgard’s Marshal of Legions, answering directly to the Primus Archivist (head of state) rather than the normal chain of military command. This gives the Aegis a semi-autonomous status – they act when the law or higher ideals compel them, even if politics say otherwise. Beneath the Paladins are about 5,000 Knights and a larger support of squires and lay brethren. Knights are organized into Dragoons (heavy infantry phalanx, the unbreakable wall of the order) and Bastioners (who often serve as commanders, quartermasters, and instructors within the order, dubbed “Knights of the Bastion”). They train rigorously in both martial and scholarly disciplines; a Knight of the Aegis is expected to quote law and philosophy as readily as wield a sword.
Role in History: For over two centuries since Aethelgard’s founding, the Argent Aegis mostly stayed out of the spotlight, quietly guarding the Library and highways, settling legal disputes in remote areas, etc. Their legend truly soared during the Crimson Snow War a decade ago. While Valoria and allies clashed with Voren, the Aegis volunteered as a bulwark in the northern front. At the pivotal Battle of Silver Tears Plain, as Voren’s undead hordes and Tenebrant mind-assaults caused allied lines to buckle, the Argent Aegis formed the unyielding center. They stood fast where others broke, their silver shields literally reflecting the pale sun in the blizzard, a sight that gave heart to all allies. Chroniclers say not a single Aegis knight fled or broke formation despite horrific losses – earning them the epithet “The Wall of Aegis.” Their defensive stand allowed Raoha Valerius’s forces to regroup and counter-attack, turning the tide. After the war, the Aegis were universally hailed as heroes. However, they remain humble and insular. They took no political office or reward beyond the thanks of the Republic (though statues of an Argent knight now guard the approach to Aethelgard’s capital in their honor).
Equipment & Relics: The Argent Aegis view their arms as holy relics and symbols. Many of their weapons and armor are heirlooms from Lumenia or forged with blessed metals. Their armor is full plate of highest quality Aethelgardian steel, plated in silver-white. Each knight’s greatshield is emblazoned with the sun-and-scale sigil of the Republic, and often personalized with scrollwork of their vow mottos. Paladins of the Aegis do not carry flashy weapons – interestingly, they forego personal weapons in favor of wielding relic blades and relic shields passed down. For example, one Paladin might bear the sword Aurora, said to have been saved from Lumenia’s royal guard, or a shield named Phaedra’s Bulwark. The Argent Verses, their codex, is their spiritual weapon – containing centuries of annotations on law, ethics, and battle prayers. In their chapterhouse (the Bastion) in Aethelgard City, an eternal flame burns in a brazier said to be lit from the last embers of Lumenia’s Great Library fire – they kindle their blades in this flame during induction ceremonies as a ritual of tempering knowledge with steel.
Political Position: The existence of such an independent order sometimes causes friction. The Aethelgardian Senate respects them deeply, but some pragmatists find the Aegis inflexible. There have been moments when the 13th Paladin opposed certain Council decrees (e.g., when a panicked Senate considered outlawing certain magical studies entirely, the Aegis lobbied for a more measured approach, threatening to veto any law that burned books outright). The military’s top brass sometimes chafe that the Aegis won’t follow orders from a Marshal if those orders conflict with higher law – though in practice, they usually align with the Republic’s defense needs. Among the people, the Argent Aegis are widely admired as paragons. Their presence in a town is cause for a festival day (bakers give free bread, children put garlands on their horses, etc.). They also have the burdensome role of internal watchdogs – if an Archivist or magistrate turns corrupt, the Aegis may be called to quietly remove and arrest them, a task no one relishes but which has kept the Republic relatively clean.
Current Outlook: In Year 270 IY, the Argent Aegis remains vigilant. With dark rumors that Voren’s defeat is temporary and that relics like the Crown of the Dark Prince stir interest, the Aegis quietly expands recruiting of new knights (only those of unblemished character and sufficient martial skill and some Spark of magic are accepted after brutal testing). The 13th Paladin has ordered a doubling of road patrols on the northern borders, sensing that shadows lengthen again. They also covertly protect certain individuals – rumor has it a few Aegis knights guard Hyperia Silvershade in secret, understanding her importance. In council with Primus Octavian, the 13th Paladin has pledged that if war comes again, the Argent Aegis will be ready to stand in the breach as they did before. “We are the shield that breaks the storm,” is a saying among them, originating from Crimson Snow. And indeed, many across Imperia take comfort that as long as the Silver Shields hold their vigil, there is a light of hope against any encroaching darkness.
XXXVI. The Tenebrant – Tyrant’s Enforcers of Dread
The Tenebrant is the shadowy apex strike force and enforcement cadre of the Voren Dominion, personally loyal to Autarch Cyrus. They are ten in number – an “elite tenfold circle of arcane-martial avatars” – and they function as the Tyrant’s literal dread hand. In the nightmares of Imperia, the Tenebrant loom large: where they walk, entire cities have fallen into silence and despair without an army needing to march. They are described not as mere mortals, but as living embodiments of will, fear, and extinction.
Composition and Leadership: The Tenebrant are led by High Kommandant Lucavyr Duskmourne, known as The Pale Strategist, who at age 41 is the youngest to ever command them. Under his chillingly calm leadership, the Tenebrant act with precision and catastrophic effect. Each member of the Tenebrant is an Inferno-tier Dark Essence user or equivalent, possessing unique deadly talents. The current roster (kept highly secret, but leaks via allied intelligence have given codenames) includes figures such as Malakor the Soulflayer (a heavy cavalry champion wreathed in soul-draining aura), Wulfric the Whisperer (their propaganda minister Voss’s assassin, rumored to kill with a spoken word), and Selene Nightseer (a sorceress specializing in shadow illusions and mind invasion). These are whispered names; to speak them loudly is to invite terror. Lucavyr stands first among equals – a brilliant strategist who combines classical tactics with psychological warfare and arcane sabotage. If Tenebrant were the fingers of a hand, Lucavyr is the calculating mind directing them.
Philosophy and Role: The Tenebrant’s very existence is engineered to inspire dread. They are Cyrus’s enforcers, dispatched to quell dissidence, eliminate high-profile targets, or lead key assaults where a normal legion would falter. Unlike the Totenkorps or regular legions, they often operate as individuals or small teams, not all ten together unless facing an extraordinary foe. Voren doctrine holds the Tenebrant as almost demigods – their images appear in propaganda murals, painted not as men but as mythic dark knights or angels of destruction. The populace of the Dominion is taught to both revere and fear them: “The Tenebrant are the silence between breaths, the question no voice dares speak,” goes an attributed quote from Wulfric. In practical terms, if a provincial governor shows disloyalty, one Tenebrant member arrives unexpectedly and by dawn heads will literally roll. If an enemy fortress has resisted all assaults, a pair of Tenebrant may infiltrate and cause such horror (assassinating the commander, turning the garrison mad with phantoms) that resistance crumbles.
Capabilities and Methods: Each Tenebrant has specialties, but they share some enhancements. All are said to bear the Sigil of Writ Silence magically etched into their very bones. This sigil does a few terrifying things: it renders them immune to magical scrying or mind reading (they are “silent” to divination), it dampens sound around them (reports say a Tenebrant’s footfalls make no noise, their incantations are felt rather than heard), and upon their death, it triggers a final curse – a “last breath oath” – that can strike down their killer or mark them for the rest of their short life. This means even killing a Tenebrant can be fatal to the victor, making them truly fearsome to face. They coordinate with eerie unity. The Tenebrant have battlefield chants that they whisper in unison, amplified by devices or acolytes, to erode enemy morale. For example, before a devastating attack, Lucavyr might whisper “You built cities from light. We bring the dark to unmake them.” across the minds of defenders – many of whom break psychologically before the physical blow lands. Tactically, Tenebrant members are often embedded briefly with regular units to stiffen them. A common pattern: the presence of one Tenebrant behind a Voren line can whip fanatical troops into a near-berserker state (out of fear and zeal) and simultaneously unnerve foes as weird phenomena begin (shadows moving strangely, disembodied whispers).
Mythos and Ritual: Within the Dominion, the Tenebrant cultivate a mythic image. They seldom speak publicly, and when they do, it’s often cryptic. Among themselves, they have secretive practices. It’s known that whenever a Tenebrant falls, the remaining nine gather in a circle and perform a mourning rite: kneeling and intoning “Let him be devoured. Let him be reborn in absence.” – hinting at their belief that their fallen comrade’s essence returns to some collective void or perhaps is reincarnated in their next recruit. They greet each other with a phrase: “One breath. One blade.” said softly when two Tenebrant cross paths – meaning they operate as one entity, one deadly purpose. Recruits into the Tenebrant (which likely come from the Übermagier or top legionnaires) undergo a transformation. It’s rumored the ritual involves a symbolic death: the recruit’s name, past, and compassion are stripped, leaving only loyalty to Cyrus’s will. They emerge bearing a Tenebrant name or title, their old identity effectively gone.
Enemies’ View: To outside forces, the Tenebrant are boogeymen. The Argent Aegis knights who’ve faced them speak of an almost preternatural terror that precedes a Tenebrant’s arrival. One account from the Crimson Snow War by a Valorian centurion describes how a single Tenebrant, likely Malakor, rode into their flank – his sword wreathed in black flame, arrows veering away from him as if afraid. Those near him either fled or froze; it was as if death itself had come. Only when an Argent Aegis paladin engaged him did the spell break and normal soldiers could function again (this matches records of how the Aegis’s faith-based mental fortitude counters Tenebrant psychic assaults). Essentially, armies plan around Tenebrant appearances: Aethelgardian battle doctrine now assigns their Dragoons and Bound Flame mages specifically to counter Tenebrant if spotted (knowing normal troops will crumble). The Free Cities, lacking such counters, rely on avoidance and subterfuge – if intelligence suggests a Tenebrant is leading a force, mercenaries are likely to desert unless huge pay is promised.
Current Activity: After their defeat in the north, the Tenebrant licked their wounds but are by no means broken. It’s believed only 3 of the 10 were slain in the war (including one by Raoha Valerius in single combat). Replacements have been elevated since. They remain at Cyrus’s side or on special missions abroad – rumor places one in the Free Cities incognito, stirring up anti-Alliance sentiment; another might have been behind the assassination of a Mercian diplomat who pushed for stricter trade embargoes on Voren. Lucavyr is certainly planning something, as scattered reports say he has studied recovered Aurion archives for “leyline nexus” knowledge – possibly to find new ways to unleash mass destruction. Should war flare again, the Tenebrant will be at the spearhead. They are the malevolent mirror to the Argent Aegis: where the Aegis stands as a wall of light and law, the Tenebrant moves as a shadow of fear and chaos. Many a frightened child in Imperia’s night is told if they don’t behave, “the Tenebrant will snatch you up.” It’s hyperbole for children – but for grown enemies of the Dominion, it’s a very real fear. The Tenebrant serve as both sword and psychological weapon for Cyrus, ensuring that his dominion over the North remains as unassailable as the night.
Voren Dominion – Total Indoctrination: The Dominion’s approach to “education” is really indoctrination from cradle to grave. Children are effectively raised by the state in the Youth Legions. At age 5 or 6, many are separated into age-cohorts (the parents have little say). They attend daily sessions at “Unity Halls” where they chant loyalty oaths to Cyrus, memorize the tenets of the Black Sun, and inform on each other’s missteps. Curriculum is entirely propaganda: history is rewritten to glorify Voren strength and depict all other nations as weak or wicked. Reading materials consist of censored war chronicles and ideological pamphlets. Only the bare minimum of practical skill is taught – enough reading to follow orders on a bulletin, basic maths to keep inventory or aim artillery. Crucially, critical thinking is suppressed. Questioning the official narrative results in punishment or disappearance. By adolescence, those showing martial promise are funneled into cadet units for the legions, where training is brutal (both physical and mental – including exposure to Dark Essence rituals to harden them). Others go to labor training. Fear and reward are the twin teachers: informants and model students (the most zealous) get privileges, dissidents get public humiliation or worse. The Dominion also uses ritual and myth in indoctrination: children participate in mass rallies where they “commune” (essentially mass hysteria exercises) to bond with the state entity. Inquisitors embed even in these youth groups to sniff out any familial loyalty overriding state loyalty – e.g., a child might be praised for denouncing a parent for heresy. Adult “education” continues through mandatory marches, ideological sessions at workplaces, and ubiquitous propaganda. Essentially, the Dominion forges minds like one would forge swords: heating with fanaticism, hammering with fear, quenching in blood.

                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Voren Dominion – commonly “The Black Sun Dominion,” “The Tyranny,” or derogatorily “Cyrus’s Chain.” Its soldiers “Voren” are dubbed “Dreadsworn.” The homeland is “the Shadow North.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Primus Archivist – also called “Archon” (especially Octavian is titled Archon), or “First Scholar.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * High Monarch of Valoria – “King/Queen of Valoria,” “High King,” or slyly by detractors “the Gilded Puppet” (because power is with Imperator). King Lucerion is called “the Old Lion.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Autarch Cyrus – known as “The Tyrant,” “Black Sun King,” or in propaganda “Father of the Dominion.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Doge of Mercia – sometimes “Chancellor,” “Prince of Coins,” or “Merchant Prince.” Lorenzo Bellini could be “Doge Bellini” or just “the Bellini Doge.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Argent Aegis – “Silver Shields,” “Aegis Knights,” or just “the Aegis.” Their leader the 13th Paladin is “the Silver Paladin.”
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * The Tenebrant – “The Dread Ten,” “Night’s Circle,” or informally “Cyrus’s Shadows.” Lucavyr is “Pale Strategist.”
This synonym map helps maintain variety in narrative tone. Using an alias can also subtly convey perspective: e.g., calling Cyrus “the Tyrant” signals a negative view, while “Autarch” is neutral. Referring to the Argent Aegis as “Silver Shields” in battle scenes feels vivid, whereas “Argent Aegis” suits formal description. Thus, these interchangeable terms enrich the immersive quality of Imperia’s lore by providing the right nuance for each context.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Mythic Epithets: Characters and places often get poetic epithets to lend legendary weight. For example, referring to Raoha Valerius as “the Black Wolf of Valoria” or Cyrus as “the Shadow of the North.” These epithets recall oral saga traditions and instantly evoke stature. Use them sparingly but consistently at dramatic moments (“Facing the Black Wolf himself, the enemy quaked.”).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Dualities and Contrasts: The narrative frequently highlights light vs dark, civilization vs barbarism, hope vs despair – core dualities of Imperia. Often phrased as short contrasts: “light has no meaning without shadow,” or “He was broken, but the dark sang truest at dusk.”. Embedding such lines reinforces theme. For instance, an Argent Aegis scene might note “they stood in darkness, proving the light’s value.”
The Heartlands: The temperate, fertile core of the continent, characterized by plains, rolling hills, and the great River Elin and River Sable. This region contains the Aethelgard Republic in the west, the Valorian Stratocracy in the east, and is scarred at its center by the magically blighted Ruins of Aurion.1
Aethelgard Republic: An aristocratic republic governed by the Council of Archivists—a senate of senior scholars, magisters, and Patrician heads—and led by an elected Primus Archivist. Its society values Ratio et Lumen (Reason and Light). The military includes the Citizen-Legions, the elite Order of the Bound Flame, and the semi-autonomous holy order, the Argent Aegis.1
Valorian Stratocracy: A martial state defined by a duality of power: the Stratocracy, the practical military authority led by the Imperator and the War Council; and the High Monarchy, the seat of historical legitimacy currently held by House Veridius. The military aristocracy is divided into factions, notably the conservative "Eagles" and the expansionist "Lions".1
Voren Dominion: A totalitarian, theocratic-military state under the absolute rule of the Tyrant-God, Cyrus. Governance is executed by the Shadow Council, a body of key ministers overseeing military, religious, and internal affairs. Society is built on a creed of ideological purity, racial supremacy, and fanatical devotion to the Black Sun Cult.1
The Argent Aegis was founded as a direct institutional response to this risk. By placing a formidable military force outside the standard chain of command and swearing its loyalty directly to the civilian state, the Republic's founders created an absolute check against both military and political overreach. This creates a constant, tense balance between the Marshal of the Legions and the 13th Paladin, embodying the friction between pragmatic military action and incorruptible defensive principle.
Voren "Houses" (Dominion): In the Voren Dominion, traditional lineage is subordinate to ideological purity and service to Cyrus. The "great houses" are lines of power, not blood, tied to the figures on the Shadow Council (e.g., Duskmourne, Fellthorn, Volkov, Cinderspire). Their status is entirely contingent on Cyrus's favor and their utility to the state.
Voren "lineage" is a PropMin construct. Cyrus systematically eradicated or subjugated the old northern clans, replacing blood loyalty with absolute ideological devotion to his new order. The "houses" of his Shadow Council are pillars of his regime, their fates inextricably tied to his own.
The Black Sun Cult (Void Creed): The Voren Dominion’s totalitarian state religion. It is a form of weaponized nihilism, preaching that life is meaningless and purpose is found only through absolute submission to the will of the Tyrant-God, Cyrus, the avatar of the Black Sun.1 It mandates Voren racial supremacy and a holy war to "purify" the world.1
Aethelgard (Faith as Law): Religion is intellectualized and codified, inseparable from law and reason. The Argent Aegis is the ultimate expression of this: a holy order whose vows are not of piety but of function—a direct, doctrinal rejection of the arcane hubris that destroyed their Lumenian ancestors.1 Their devotion is to the
Cyrus's unification of the Voren clans was a religious revolution. He co-opted and weaponized nascent Black Sun prophecies, transforming scattered, primal Void cults into a monolithic, fanatical state ideology that could fuel a continental war.1
Aethelgard Republic (The Reasoned Shield):
Forces: Citizen-Legions (disciplined heavy infantry forming the Murus Ferreus or "Iron Wall"), the Order of the Bound Flame (elite Light Arcanist cadres integrated into legions), and the Argent Aegis (a semi-autonomous holy order sworn to a purely defensive mandate).1
Valorian Stratocracy (The Iron Fist):
Forces: The Dreadsworn Legions (fanatical, often poorly equipped but expendable infantry), the Totenkorps (heavily armored, terror-inducing shock troops), and The Tenebrant (an elite guard of Inferno-tier Übermagier who serve as Cyrus's personal enforcers and arcane artillery).1
The Crimson Snow War (255-265 IY) was the crucible that defined modern military doctrines. It proved the devastating effectiveness of Voren terror tactics, the unyielding defensive strength of the Argent Aegis at chokepoints like Widow's Pass, and the necessity of brilliant, adaptive command—as demonstrated by Raoha Valerius—to counter a fanatical foe.1
An ongoing arms race defines the current stalemate. Aethelgard develops more sophisticated Light Essence wards and arcane countermeasures. Valoria perfects its Luminarite steel and siegecraft. The Voren Dominion, under Magister Volkov, pursues forbidden bio-arcane research (Project Chimera/Titanica) to create super-soldiers, viewing conventional warfare as a mere prelude to a new form of biological and magical annihilation.1
Voren Dominion (Law as Terror): Law is the absolute and fluid will of Cyrus, enforced by the Obsidian Eye. There is no concept of justice, only ideological enforcement and the purification of the state. "Trials" are political theater, and denunciation of neighbors is a civic duty.1
The Unbreakable Oath: Oaths are a potent social and sometimes magical force. The most rigid example is the Argent Aegis's Unwavering Vow—a set of three functional, martial oaths (The Vow of the Shield, Light, and Fealty) that define their existence. This code places them outside the standard military command structure, a deliberate check on political and military power.1
Aethelgard - The Trial of Corvus "Veritas" (c. 185 IY): A Special Tribunal of the Council convicted the Magister for unsanctioned Ecliptra research. The verdict, based on the Lex Archivistorum, was exile and the ritual burning of his work. This established the precedent for suppressing forbidden knowledge, prioritizing state stability over intellectual freedom.1
The Obsidian Citadel: The seat of the Voren Dominion. A colossal, terrifying fortress of black volcanic rock and fused obsidian, designed to dwarf the individual and inspire absolute fear. It is a monument to totalitarian power and the Voren creed of domination.1
Ruins of Lumengarde & Mount Caelus: A paired set of sites in the Dragon's Tooth mountains. Lumengarde is the beautiful but warped ruin of the ancient city of Ecliptra masters, a symbol of failed ambition.1 Towering above it is Mount Caelus, Imperia's highest peak and the sacred site where the Argent Aegis forges its Paladins—a symbol of redemption through trial and truth.1
The Argent Spire (New Lumenia): The fortress-city of the Argent Aegis. A marvel of perfect, ordered architecture and defensible design, it is a society built entirely around the order's unwavering vows—a living ideal of Aethelgardian principles made manifest.1
Urban design is ideology. Aethelgard's open forums and libraries are built to encourage debate and scholarship. Highmount's narrow, defensible streets and high walls are built for war. The Obsidian Citadel's colossal, inhuman scale is designed to crush the individual will and enforce conformity.1
Sacred sites are often twinned with sites of failure. The proximity of Mount Caelus to the ruins of Lumengarde is a constant, physical reminder for the Argent Aegis: the path to true strength and enlightenment requires turning one's back on the valley of ruin and beginning the arduous ascent.1
Arms & Armor: High-quality, standardized legionary equipment. Lorica Laminata (segmented plate) and Lorica Hamata (mail), large rectangular Scutum shields, and crested Galea helmets. The Argent Aegis wields unique, masterwork Lumenian steel.1
Pageants of Purification (Voren) — Premise: Mass state rallies involving military parades, fanatical chants, and the public, ritual sacrifice of prisoners or "traitors." • Cultural Function: Enforces absolute ideological conformity, inspires terror, and reinforces the citizen's submission to the state and Cyrus. • Narrative Use: A display of the Voren regime's terrifying power and fanaticism.1
Gryphons (Threat Level: Tactical): Majestic, winged predators with the body of a lion and the head and talons of an eagle. Native to the high peaks of the Titan's Spine and Dragon's Tooth mountains. Fiercely territorial and difficult to tame, they are used as elite aerial mounts by the Valorian Stratocracy, signifying immense status.1
Aegis Phalanx: The signature defensive formation of the Argent Aegis, a tight wall of interlocked shields reinforced by Light Essence.1
Argent Aegis: A holy military order of Aethelgard, sworn to a purely defensive mandate. Also known as the "Silver Shield."1
Black Sun Cult: The totalitarian state religion of the Voren Dominion, which deifies the Tyrant-God Cyrus and preaches a doctrine of nihilism, racial purity, and conquest. Alias: Void Creed.1
Eagles: The conservative, traditionalist faction within the Valorian Stratocracy's military aristocracy, emphasizing defense and the strict Honor Code.1
Lex Archivistorum: The vast, codified body of law that governs the Aethelgard Republic.1
Lions: The expansionist, pragmatic faction within the Valorian Stratocracy's military aristocracy, favoring aggressive tactics and modernization.1
Paladin: One of the thirteen supreme commanders of the Argent Aegis. All are Inferno-Tier Arcanists who have passed a harrowing spiritual trial.1
Ratio et Lumen: "Reason and Light." The guiding state philosophy of the Aethelgard Republic, emphasizing logic, order, and the controlled use of Light Essence.1
The Tenebrant: The elite guard of the Voren Tyrant-God, composed of ten of the most powerful Inferno-tier Übermagier in the Dominion.1
The Obsidian Hegemony of Vorr (c. 3800–2200 BCE): A brutal, expansionist slave empire in the Northern Reaches, the direct ideological precursor to the Voren Dominion.1 Ruled by Warlord-Shamans, they worshipped chthonic Void entities through mass blood sacrifice and wielded primal Dark Essence and geomancy.1 Their collapse was due to resource depletion, massive thrall rebellions, and internal schisms, fragmenting into the clans Cyrus would later unify.1
XVII. The Argent Aegis: A Study in Votive Power
► Scope: The genesis, doctrine, hierarchy, and sacred traditions of the Holy Order of the Argent Aegis, the sworn protectors of Aethelgard.
Hierarchy & Structure: A semi-autonomous "Holy Contingent" within the Aethelgardian state. Their commander, the 13th Paladin, answers only to the Primus Archivist and the Council, holding a rank equal to the Marshal of the Legions.1 This creates a deliberate check on military power. The order consists of the
The Aegis's legend was forged in the Crimson Snow War (255-265 IY). While Raoha Valerius was the "spear" of the allied forces, the Aegis was the "Unbreakable Wall." Their stand at Widow's Pass and their role as the anchor of the allied line at the Silver Tears Plain were purely defensive actions that prevented catastrophic collapse and made Raoha's victories possible.1
► Scope: The cultural and societal texture of the Aethelgard Republic, from its foundational myths and legal precedents to the nuances of daily life and the shadows of its underworld.
► Scope: The cultural and societal texture of the Valorian Stratocracy, where the forge, the feast hall, and the battlefield are the crucibles that shape every aspect of life.
Trial of Lord Kaelen "Oathbreaker" (c. 260 IY): A historical case where a Legate of House Blackthorn was accused of betraying an allied Free City legion for strategic gain. He was judged by a "Trial of the Shield Ring," a combat ordeal against three champions. His defeat was his verdict. The case reinforces the principle that the Honor Code extends to sworn allies, a precedent that makes Raoha's later actions so heinous.1
Foundational Myth ("The Black Sun's Revelation"): The core state myth, propagated by the Ministry of Will & Word (PropMin). It tells how Cyrus received a vision from the Void, revealing the "corruption" of the South and his divine mandate to lead the Voren race in a sacred crusade of purification.1
Epic Poem ("The Obsidian Cantos"): A collection of verses, attributed to Cyrus, that form the lyrical core of Voren ideology. They are chanted at mass rallies and taught from birth, speaking of the Void's cold beauty, the strength found in sacrifice, and the glorious oblivion awaiting true believers.1
Law as Will: There is no formal legal code, only the absolute and fluid will of Cyrus, enforced by the Obsidian Eye. "Trials" are political theater to root out impurity; denunciation of neighbors is a civic duty.1
The Obsidian System: Education is replaced by total indoctrination. Children are raised in state crèches, their loyalty transferred from family to Cyrus. The curriculum is the Obsidian Sermons, racial purity doctrine, and the art of informing. Critical thought is treason.1
Arts & Underworld: Art is totalitarian and monumental, designed to dwarf the individual. The only "underworld" is organized resistance, like the "Forgotten Sons"—remnants of clans purged by Cyrus who engage in sabotage and are ruthlessly hunted by the Obsidian Eye.1
► Scope: The reclusive, master-smith culture of the Stonekin, their societal structure, their unique relationship with the mountains, and their pragmatic, honor-bound alliance with the Valorian Stratocracy.
The Forgotten Sons (Voren Dominion): A desperate resistance movement composed of the remnants of noble lines and clans purged by Cyrus. They engage in sabotage and guerilla warfare, and are ruthlessly hunted by the Obsidian Eye. Their existence is officially denied by the state.1
c. 1–150 IY — The Age of Forging: The Aethelgard Republic, Valorian Kingdom, and Mercian Oligarchy are formally established. The Free Cities declare their independence. King Vallus "Iron-Hand" unifies Valoria. The Khaganate is united under Altan Khan. The first Azure Concord is formed in the Myriad Kingdoms.1
c. 151–250 IY — The Age of Consolidation & Conflict: The successor states solidify their borders and power, leading to inevitable clashes. Key events include the First Voren Incursion (c. 203 IY), the War of Sable Rivers (Aethelgard vs. Valoria, c. 219 IY), and the rise of Cyrus in the Voren North (c. 230 IY onwards).1
255–265 IY — The War of the Crimson Snow: The newly unified Voren Dominion under Cyrus launches a massive invasion of the South. The war defines the modern generation, cementing the Voren as the primary existential threat and creating legends like Raoha Valerius and Eldric Bloodmoon. It ends in a costly victory for the Pact of Iron & Light.1
266–270 IY — The Gathering Storm: A tense interbellum period. The Voren secretly rearm and accelerate forbidden research (Project Titanica). Valoria fractures internally. Rumors of the Crown of the Dark Prince's rediscovery begin to circulate, igniting a shadow war among the great powers and setting the stage for the current crisis.1
Vel'Darah, The Blade of Whispering Despair: Forged concurrently with the Crown, incorporating the essence of Elarion's ashes. It is a potent conduit for a twisted mimicry of Ecliptra, granting its wielder immense combat prowess at the cost of their soul. It actively corrupts its user, feeding on negative emotions. Currently wielded by Raoha Valerius.1
Lumenian Blades (e.g., Aeglos, Anglachel): The thirteen semi-sentient blades wielded by the Paladins of the Argent Aegis. Forged with lost techniques and infused with pure Light Essence, they are immune to corruption and sing in the hands of a worthy wielder.1
Cyrus (Voren Dominion): PIQ: 98. The Tyrant-God. Absolute ruler of the Dominion, an Inferno-tier Dark Mage, and the primary driver of the world's central conflict. His will is law for millions of fanatics.1
Archon Octavian Lysandreth (Aethelgard): PIQ: 89. The Primus Archivist. Leader of the Aethelgard Republic, controlling vast resources and knowledge. A key figure in the anti-Voren alliance.1
Raoha Valerius (Valoria): PIQ: 88 (Volatile). The "Black Wolf," now the "Dusk Sovereign." A legendary war hero turned rogue commander, corrupted by Vel'Darah. His actions threaten to plunge Valoria into civil war. Unknowingly the true heir to the Valerian throne.1
High Priestess Vespera (Voren Dominion): PIQ: 86. Head of the Black Sun Cult, she shapes Voren ideology and is a powerful Inferno Dark Mage in her own right. A key pillar of Cyrus's regime.1
The Triumvirate Prime: Three perfectly preserved Eidolarch specimens—two male, one female—discovered frozen in a hidden sanctum. They are the secret heart of Project Titanica.1
XXXVI. The Tenebrant: The Tyrant-God's Shadow Guard
► Scope: The structure, purpose, and key members of The Tenebrant, the most elite and feared unit in the Voren Dominion.
Composition: An elite guard of ten of the most powerful Inferno-tier Übermagier in the Dominion, serving as Cyrus's personal enforcers, arcane artillery, and Praetorian Guard. Membership is a life-long, inescapable vow.1
Mandate: Their primary duties are the absolute personal protection of Cyrus, the execution of high-stakes covert operations, acting as a strategic arcane reserve in critical battles, and serving as the ultimate tool of terror and enforcement within the Dominion.1
Internal Dynamics: While fanatically loyal to Cyrus, the members are rivals for his favor. A secret "Mirrored Circle" is rumored to exist, answering only to Wisteria, with Serathen and Daeonir as potential members.1
Syntax: Repetitive, chant-like cadences. Use of absolute, non-negotiable statements. The collective "we" or the deified "He" (Cyrus) often replaces the individual "I."
Curriculum Spine: Absolute ideological saturation. The curriculum consists of the Obsidian Sermons of Cyrus, Voren racial purity doctrine, the history of southern "decadence," and the art of informing on peers. Critical thought is treason; rote memorization and fanatical obedience are the only goals.1
Ideal Individual: Fanatically loyal to Cyrus and the Black Sun, ideologically pure, ruthless, efficient, and willing to sacrifice everything for the state. Individuality is a flaw; conformity is a virtue.
Aethelgard Republic (The Bastion of Reason):
1-100 IY (Covenant of Ash & Scroll): Founded by a triumvirate of Aurionic survivors: Magister Caius Lysandreth (The Lawgiver), High Priestess Elara Veyl (The Illuminator), and General Tiberius Volusenus (The Pragmatist). The "Schism of Intent" (47 IY) saw the Preservationist faction win, cementing Aethelgard's identity as a republic of scholars, not conquerors. The Lex Archivistorum was codified.1
Valorian Stratocracy (The Iron Forged in Ash):
261-270 IY (A Kingdom Divided): The aftermath of the Crimson Snow War, Imperator Titus Veridian's compromised rule, and Raoha Valerius's transformation into the rogue Dusk Sovereign have fractured the Stratocracy. The Eagle vs. Lion schism threatens to plunge the kingdom into civil war.1
230-255 IY (The Rise of Cyrus): Cyrus, a figure of unparalleled Dark Essence mastery and strategic genius, forcibly unified the clans, crushing rivals like the Frost Elders Coalition. Aided by figures like Wulfric (propaganda), Morwen (ideology), and Volkov (technology), he forged a monolithic totalitarian state.1
255-270 IY (The Gathering Shadow): The War of the Crimson Snow was the Dominion's first great southern campaign. Its defeat was spun as a temporary setback, fueling a desire for vengeance. The subsequent interbellum has been a period of intense, covert rearmament and acceleration of forbidden research (Project Chimera), setting the stage for a new, more terrifying war.1
► A. Aethelgard Republic: The Culture of Reason and Ritual
► B. Valorian Stratocracy: The Culture of Steel and Sacrifice
Epic Poem ("The Obsidian Cantos"): A collection of verses, attributed to Cyrus, that form the lyrical core of Voren ideology. They are chanted at mass rallies and taught from birth, speaking of the Void's cold beauty and the strength found in sacrifice.1
Arts & Underworld: Art is totalitarian and monumental, designed to dwarf the individual.1 The only "underworld" is organized resistance, like the "Forgotten Sons"—remnants of clans purged by Cyrus who engage in sabotage and are ruthlessly hunted.1
The Opening Storm (255 IY): The Voren invasion was a masterpiece of shock and awe. The Stand at Widow's Pass by the Argent Aegis, however, proved the Voren doctrine of terror could be broken by unyielding, fanatical resolve. A single Tercia of Aegis Dragoons held the pass for three days, forming the Aegis Phalanx and using coordinated Light Essence pulses to repel shadow-curses. They became an immovable object, allowing the main Aethelgardian army to escape annihilation.1
The Battle of the Silver Tears Plain (262 IY): This was the war's defining battle. Cyrus himself took the field, unleashing The Tenebrant. Malakor the Soulflayer's psychic terror shattered allied lines. Eldric Bloodmoon, Aethelgard's "Lion of the Light," fell in a duel with Cyrus. In the ensuing chaos, a 17-year-old Centurion, Raoha Valerius, led a suicidal charge that stalled the Tenebrant advance and allowed the allied line to stabilize. The battle was a tactical draw, but it denied Cyrus his decisive victory and marked the beginning of Raoha's legend.1
The Blackreach Campaign (264-265 IY): The war's final campaign. Raoha Valerius, now a commander, executed a masterful "elastic defense," luring the Voren into a deathtrap within the Blackreach canyons. The Argent Aegis played a crucial, unglamorous role, guarding the campaign's exposed northern flank, a silent wall that prevented Voren reinforcements from disrupting Raoha’s intricate plan. The spear could only strike because the shield held true.1
► Signals for Scenes: A veteran's recurring nightmare of Malakor the Soulflayer's psychic assault • a tavern ballad celebrating Eldric Bloodmoon's last stand • a Valorian strategist studying maps of the Blackreach canyons, marveling at Raoha's audacity.
XLV. The Fate of Houses: A Post-Cataclysm Ledger (270 IY)
House Stormborn: Extinct as a landed power. Hyperia and Gwyneira represent the last of the direct line, their true Valorian history unknown to them. Their survival is a secret that could have dangerous consequences for King Lucerion.1
The Shadow Council Lines (Duskmourne, Fellthorn, Volkov, Cinderspire, Kryllos): These are not true noble houses but lines of power whose status is entirely derived from their position within Cyrus's regime. They hold immense power but are locked in constant, covert rivalry, their fates entirely dependent on Cyrus's favor.1 Wisteria's House Kryllos, an old noble line subjugated by marriage, is in the most precarious position.1
Voren Dominion (Law as Terror): Law is the absolute and fluid will of Cyrus, enforced by the Obsidian Eye. "Trials" are political theater to root out impurity and enforce ideological conformity. Denunciation of neighbors is a civic duty.
 Daily Oath of Fealty to Cyrus is mandatory for all citizens.1
Cultural Significance: The ultimate status symbol within the Valorian Stratocracy. A Gryphon mount signifies a warrior of legendary skill and immense standing. Their screeches are considered a holy omen in some knighting ceremonies.1
Legacy: Legends of "Sky Lords" and "Cloud Palaces." Valorian Stormbound Cavalry techniques may be a distant adaptation. Hyperia Stormborn's Ecliptra potential could be a mutated echo of a lost Aeravine bloodline.1
Decline: Collapsed due to resource depletion, massive thrall rebellions ("The Great Thrall Wars"), and internal schisms, fragmenting into the clans Cyrus would later unify.1
Legacy: The direct ideological and cultural precursor to the Voren Dominion. Cyrus explicitly sees himself as the inheritor of the Hegemony's strength and destiny.1
Legacy: A dark precursor to Aurion's Cataclysm. Its fall represents the tragedy of balanced power undone by ambition. The Argent Aegis was founded by its survivors as a direct rejection of its failure. Its secrets are the key to understanding the Crown of the Dark Prince.1
► Scope: An ontological and strategic quantification of the major powers of Imperia, detailing their populations, military mobilization capacities, and the relative combat effectiveness of their martial units as per the Aethelgardian Strategic Unit Valuation System (SUVS).
Argent Aegis Dragoon: 300 Points. Fanatical devotion, superior Lumenian steel, and integrated Light Essence defense make each a bastion against which lesser troops break. 1
Black Vexillum Veteran (Raoha's Host): 250 Points. Hardened by countless battles and unshackled from the Honor Code, they fight with a savage, terrifying efficiency. 1
The Thirteen Paladins (Argent Aegis): ~25,000 Points each. An Inferno-tier Luminara who is also a master strategist and warrior. The presence of a single Paladin is a strategic reality-warping event. 1
Raoha Valerius (The Dusk Sovereign): ~150,000 Points. A "Force Singularity." His presence inspires fanatical courage in his followers and crippling fear in his foes. His martial prowess, amplified by Vel'Darah, allows him to shatter elite formations single-handedly. His instability is his only tactical flaw. 1
Cyrus (The Tyrant-God): ~200,000 Points. An Inferno-tier Übermagier of immense power, a strategic genius, and a quasi-divine figure whose hypnotic charisma provides a supernatural morale boost to his entire army. 1
The Tenebrant (Collective): While individual members are hero-tier, their true power is in unified ritual. As a collective, they can enact cataclysmic spells—storms of shadow, mass resurrections, continent-spanning curses—whose SUVS value is incalculable. 1
Hyperia Stormborn (The Catalyst Anomaly): Unrated. Her potential is beyond the scale. A fully realized Hyperia could nullify other magics, tear open reality, or challenge artifacts directly. Her value is not a number, but an infinity symbol—a double-edged sword of apocalyptic potential. 1
Argent Aegis → {Silver Shield, Custodes Argenti}
The Tenebrant → {The Tyrant-God's Shadow Guard}
Argent Aegis • Holy military order of Aethelgard; purely defensive mandate, ultimate check on power.
Cyrus • Tyrant-God of the Voren Dominion; primary antagonist, Inferno Dark Mage.
Hyperia Stormborn • The only known living Inferno Catalyst; a walking cosmological paradox.
Raoha Valerius • Legendary Valorian general, now the Dusk Sovereign; unknowing true heir, corrupted by Vel'Darah.
Wisteria Kryllos • Consort to Cyrus; master of intrigue, survivor of a subjugated noble house.
