I. INTRODUCTION & LORE INTEGRATION
A. Overview: The Ancient Game of Thrones
King’s Fall (High Imperian: Regis Cadere) is Imperia’s oldest, most revered strategic board game—a distilled model of conquest, influence, leadership, and the lurching hand of history via Chronicle events. Two players command asymmetric factions in a contest of tempo, maneuver, and brinkmanship.
B. Theme: Conflicts of Imperia
Each match reenacts a historical or mythic clash. Players assume legendary Sovereigns—Kings, Queens, Wardens, Khans, Mage-Lords—each with unique kits, leaders, and events. Modern manifests and boards were standardized by the ACSA to preserve asymmetry and fair competitive play.
C. Cultural Significance & History
From simple travel sets in legion tents to luminous crystal boards in archon halls, King’s Fall is ubiquitous. The Imperian Strategos League (ISL) maintains rankings (the Gladius Index), curates maps, and hosts major tournaments.

II. GAME COMPONENTS (SANCTIONED TOURNAMENT SET)
A. The Strategos Game Board
Point-to-point network (typically 24–32 Locations grouped into 5–7 Territories), each Location named, typed (City, Fortress, Forest, Pass, Ruins, Nexus, etc.), and printed with a base CP (Command Point) value (normally 1–2).
B. Aetherium-Infused Faction Sets
Each faction includes: 1 Sovereign, Luminaries (Leaders), a pool of Units (Basic/Elite), Influence markers, and a Concordance Scroll (rulesheet). Premium sets are cast in Aetherium resin/Lumenstone with a faint internal glow; cheaper sets use wood or clay.
C. The Chronicle Deck (Event Cards)
66 cards on quality stock. Anatomy: Title, Ops value (1–4), Event text, optional Faction Icon (Aethelgard / Valoria / Voren / Neutral), and a lore note. The deck is balanced to create hard choices between ops economy vs. powerful Events.
D. Combat Dice (Solidi & Umbra)
5 Solidi (Defender) and 5 Umbra (Attacker) six-siders. Contrasting colors emphasize simultaneous resolution.
E. Command Tokens (Aurum & Argentum)
Metal/card tokens for CP (1s and 5s).
F. Chronometers (Turn & Game)
Turn Timer (typically 5 minutes) and a Game Timer (90–180 minutes format-dependent).
G. The Codex Strategos (Rulebook)
This document consolidates rules, setup, manifests, glossary, and tournament regs.

III. GAME SETUP
A. Board & Components
Place the board centrally; supply dice, CP tokens, and the Chronicle deck.
B. Faction Selection & Deployment
Choose factions; take pieces and each faction’s Concordance Scroll. Place starting Influence, Units, and Sovereign as indicated on your Scroll. Starting CP = 8 per player (tournament standard).
C. Chronicle Deck & Starting Hand
Shuffle; deal 6 Chronicle cards to each player.
D. Timers & First Player (ACSA Method)
Set the Game Timer. Both players roll 1 die; high roller chooses to play first or second. Assign the Turn Timer to the first player. (This replaces older matchup-based or coin-flip variants.)
________________


IV. GAMEPLAY & TURN STRUCTURE (THE STRATEGEM CYCLE)
A. Round Overview
Players alternate turns until both pass consecutively or both hands are empty; then the Round ends. Discard any remaining cards (mandatory) and deal 6 new cards to each player. (This clarifies and replaces past “optional-discard” variants.)
B. Turn Phases
1) Influence Phase (start of your turn)
 • Gain CP = sum of CP values on Locations you control +1 CP per fully controlled Territory (you control all Locations in that Territory); minimum 3 CP.
• Draw 1 Chronicle card (max hand size 7; immediately discard down if exceeded).
2) Action Phase (timed—5 minutes standard)
 You must play exactly one Chronicle card, choosing one mode:
• Play for Ops: Reveal it. If it bears your opponent’s Faction Icon, your opponent may choose to immediately trigger and resolve its Event before you gain Ops. Then you gain Ops equal to the card’s Ops value and spend them on Standard Actions. (If Neutral or your Icon, no Event triggers when played for Ops.)
• Play for Event: Resolve the Event text in full. You gain no Ops unless the Event itself grants them.
You may keep taking Standard Actions until Ops are spent or your Turn Timer expires. Unspent Ops are lost.
3) Resolution Phase
 Check victory (Regicide). Pass the Turn Timer; your opponent begins their Influence Phase. If both pass consecutively or both hands are empty, resolve Round end (see IV.A).
C. Standard Actions (Using Ops)
Unless noted, the cost is per use; you may mix actions while Ops remain.
• Place Influence (1 Op): Place 1 of your Influence in a Location that (a) contains your Units/Luminary/Sovereign, or (b) is adjacent by a path to a Location where you already have Units or Influence. Control flips when you have strictly more Influence than the opponent; remove their marker when control changes. Limit 1 placement per Location per Action Phase (you can place in multiple different Locations this turn).
• Recruit Units (1 Op per Basic; 2 Ops per Elite): Place in a controlled City or Fortress; obey pool limits. (Optional table cap: max 3 recruits per turn for pace.)
• Move (1 Op per Group per Connection): Move any-size stack along one path to an adjacent Location. Some units/factions may move farther per Op (e.g., cavalry). Entering an enemy-occupied Location initiates Combat immediately.
• Fortify (2 Ops; Fortresses only): Increase that Fortress’s defensive CV bonus for the next combat this Round.
• Strategic Redeployment (3 Ops): Move Units between two friendly controlled Locations regardless of adjacency (respect any faction limits).
• Activate Luminary/Sovereign Ability (variable Ops): Pay the cost on your Concordance Scroll; each Leader/Sovereign may activate once per Round unless otherwise stated.
Stack Limit & Sovereign Stacking
 Max 6 Units/Luminaries in a stack per Location. The Sovereign does not count toward the 6 but may not end a turn alone in a Location—recruit or move with escort.

V. COMBAT SYSTEM (THE CRUCIBLE OF CONFLICT)
A. Initiation & Pre-Combat Window
Combat begins when the Attacker enters an enemy-occupied Location. Before any dice are rolled, there is a single Pre-Combat Window: first the Defender, then the Attacker, may do ONE of: play a Combat Event or activate ONE ability labeled “Before Combat Rolls.”
B. Determining Combat Value (CV) & Dice
1. CV Sources: Sum Unit CV; add Leader/Sovereign CV; add Terrain (e.g., Fortress +2 CV (Defender); Forest/Ruins +1 CV (Defender)).

2. Elite Units count as 1.5 CV—keep the fraction through calculation.

3. Dice = floor(final CV), capped at 5 dice. Attacker rolls Umbra; Defender rolls Solidi.

C. Modifiers, Re-rolls, and Resolution
Cards/abilities may permit a targeted re-roll (a die can be re-rolled once) or +1 to your single highest die. After modifiers, compare single highest die; Defender wins ties. The loser removes 1 Unit; if none remain, remove a Luminary; if only the Sovereign remains, it suffers 1 wound.
D. Combat Rounds
Combat is exactly 2 Rounds unless a side is eliminated earlier. Resolve Round 1 in full, then Round 2.
E. Retreat & Elimination
After Round 1, the Attacker may retreat surviving pieces to the origin Location. If they do, the Defender rolls 1 parting-shot die; on 5+ the Attacker removes 1 retreating Unit (their choice). If the Attacker eliminates all Defenders, they seize control and place 1 Influence (survivors remain). If the Defender eliminates all Attackers, they hold. If both sides still remain after Round 2, the Attacker must retreat to origin; the Defender holds. (This replaces prior “no-retreat” variants.)

VI. SOVEREIGN VULNERABILITY & VICTORY CONDITIONS
• The Sovereign is powerful (default CV 3, Health 3) and grants unique abilities—protect it.
• Regicide (Primary): Eliminate the enemy Sovereign to win instantly.
• Concession: Opponent yields.
• Time: If the Game Timer expires, highest total CP on the board wins. Tie-break: (1) most fully controlled Territories; (2) most controlled Locations; (3) higher Gladius Index (if applicable).

XII. HISTORICAL CONTEXT & EVOLUTION
From mythic prototypes to post-Cataclysm standardization, this edition finalizes clean timing windows, a consistent retreat rule, clarified Icons logic, and precise Ops/Event interactions.
________________


XIII. LLM SIMULATION GUIDE & MECHANICS REFERENCE (ABRIDGED)
• Core Loop: CP income → card choice (Ops vs Event) → Ops allocation → capped-dice combats → positional scoring.
• Key Decisions: Regicide risks, Territory locks, deck state (Icons), timer pressure.
• Combat Algorithm: Compute CV with fractional elites; dice=floor(CV) (cap 5); apply modifiers; compare highest; loser attrits; 2 Rounds; retreat window after R1.
________________


XIV. GLOSSARY
CP: Command Points (income/spend).
Ops: Operational Points (action currency).
CV: Combat Value (translates to dice).
Luminary: Leader piece.
Sovereign: Monarch piece.
Parting Shot: Defender’s 1 die on 5+ when Attacker retreats after R1.
________________


XV. DESIGNER’S COMMENTARY & BALANCE PHILOSOPHY (SUMMARY)
Resolved contradictions & standardizations:
 • First Player = ACSA die method; winner chooses.
• Income = sum of controlled Location CP +1 per fully controlled Territory (min 3).
• End-of-Round = mandatory hand discard + new 6.
• Opponent-Icon trigger (Play for Ops) = optional (opponent may choose to fire) and resolves before Ops.
• Influence placement = 1 per Location per Action Phase (no global cap).
• Stack limit = 6 Units/Luminaries; Sovereign not counted but can’t be alone.
• Pre-Combat window = Defender then Attacker.
• Retreat = Attacker may retreat after Round 1 (parting shot on 5+); if still locked after Round 2, Attacker must retreat.
• CV/Dice = elites 1.5 CV; dice=floor(CV); cap 5.
Asymmetry parity:
 Stonekin tie-attrition clarified; Sylvani denial not over-favored if Forest density is governed; Khaganate mobility gated by once/round Feigned Retreat; Voren fear limited to Round 1; Aethelgard excels at tempo denial. Result: unique kits, stable parity, high skill ceiling.

XVI. WORKED EXAMPLES (PLAY EXAMPLES)
1) Ops vs Event with Opponent Icon
 You (Aethelgard) play a Voren-icon card for Ops. The Voren opponent may choose to fire the Event first; they decline. You then gain 3 Ops and spend them: Place Influence (twice, in different Locations) and Recruit once.
2) Combat with Elite CV & Retreat
 Your stack (2× Legionaries + 1× Elite Centurion) attacks a Fortress. Your CV = 1 + 1 + 1.5 = 3.5 ⇒ floor=3 dice; Defender CV includes Fortress +2 and rolls up to 5 dice (cap). After Round 1, you retreat; Defender rolls parting shot—misses on 4.
3) Stonekin Tie Attrition
 As Defender with Shield-Brother Durn, the highest dice tie. You already hold (Defender wins ties), and Durn additionally forces the Attacker to remove 1 extra Unit (attrition). They think twice about Round 2.
